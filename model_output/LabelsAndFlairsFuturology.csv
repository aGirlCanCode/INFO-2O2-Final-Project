universe learned laws classical physics taught motions possible objects undergo year took quantum mechanics first thing learned quite difficult comprehend fact characteristics world explained classical physics thus new model needed order explain observations challenging believe science previously learned appeared absolute fact true situation began journey wormhole journey began last

limit clock travelling speed close speed light run slower one rest time relative speed something moving Understanding concept extremely liberating first time life concepts time travel seemed

three dimensional creatures humans level smaller atoms molecules also exist wrinkles holes third dimension humans small enough travel holes connected different space time holes therefore thought

wormhole see past happen decided shoot earlier self dead fired shot reason believe possible travel past laws cause effect prohibit Furthermore paradox leads ask question one travel wormhole back time possible time travel one future Earlier discussed fourth dimension difficult imagine bound exist limitations third dimension article Stephen Hawking compares fourth dimension time river flows

gravity causes time slow object massive amount normal matter experience time travel past order wormhole allow time travel future need negative space time curvature thought anti gravity However order matter possess characteristic anti gravity negative mass energy concept seem possible However research found principle uncertainty quantum mechanics states space areas fact contain negative energy thus enabling field future time travel possible Realizing came conclusion wormhole therefore consist matter negative mass object placed matter time speed object emerged side tunnel find future Unfortunately evidence proves possibility forward time travel way person travel wormhole exist level smaller atoms molecules So begs question way time travel order answer question revisit Einstein
