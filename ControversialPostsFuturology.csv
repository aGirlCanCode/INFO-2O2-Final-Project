6,2inow8,2014-10-08,text - sensational/misleading,text,daddie_o,"**Clean, Cheap, Unlimited Energy is Here:** Independent Tests Show Cold Fusion Reactor Produces More than 3X the Power Put In, Energy Density 100 Times Larger Than Any Chemical Source, No Radioactive Emissions or Byproducts","This is big, big news. Monumental. Imagine how clean, cheap, virtually unlimited energy will change the world. An end to global warming, clean and plentiful water for everyone, enhanced potential for space travel, and on and on. This is truly a pivotal moment in human history. 

This post is long, but bear with me. It's worth it. First, some background: 

The E-Cat (Energy Catalyzer) is a power generator developed by Italian inventor Andrea Rossi that is based on Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), aka ""Cold Fusion."" Although LENR is a nuclear reaction, which probably harnesses the weak nuclear force, it does not produce harmful radioactive byproducts, and it uses hydrogen and metal (nickel, palladium, lithium) to create clean energy. 

Although the science behind cold fusion was discredited in 1989, numerous scientists continued to do research in the field, amassing more evidence and theory behind the discovery announced by Fleischman and Pons in 1989. [Here is a link to a 60-minutes piece on Cold Fusion from 2009.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTvaX3vRtRA) There are still some mysteries behind LENR, but current scientific theories of how it works are consistent with the Standard Model of physics. 

Fast forward to 2011, Andrea Rossi announces that, with the help of an Italian physicist, he has developed a reactor based on LENR that produces much more heat than is required to start the reaction. The announcement was met mainly with skepticism and collective indifference. But he continued to develop the technology and sold the rights to a US company, Industrial Heat, which continued to work on it with him. (At the same time, several other companies have developed working prototypes of LENR-baseed power generation, but E-Cat is ahead of the pack.) 

Still, skepticism persisted despite a test from outside evaluators. Today a [new, thorough independent 3rd party report](http://www.sifferkoll.se/sifferkoll/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LuganoReportSubmit.pdf) on the operation of the E-Cat was released. Some of the TL;DR highlights of the report:

- The E-cat ran with a Coefficient of Power of between 3.2 to 3.8. This means that it produced between 3.2 to 3.8 times more energy than was required to generate the reaction (which also means that, once started, some of the energy produced can be redirected to continue powering the reaction). 

- The E-cat produces ""more than two orders of magnitude"" more energy than any known conventional energy source. Given the weight and maximum volume of the e-cat reactor, which was sealed and in the possession of the researchers the entire time, *there is simply no known chemical power source that could provide the amount of power the E-Cat generated continuously over 32 days of testing.*

- The reactor fuel undergoes significant isotopic and compositional change (measured before and after): ""the burning process in E-Cat indeed changes the fuel at the nuclear level, i.e. nuclear reactions have taken place."" 

- No harmful radiation, radioactive byproducts or greenhouse gases are produced. 

- The fuel required to run the reaction appears to be a combination of nickel powder and Lithium Aluminum Hydride. These are abundant minerals and very little is required to produce this reaction. 

If you own any stocks in oil, gas or coal companies, now would be a good time to sell them. 

Edit:

Honestly people, this is futurology. I thought you'd be a little more open-minded instead of so reflexively, dogmatically dismissive. I mean, at least look into it a bit before you dismiss it. Maybe even read the report. I don't have time to rebut the skeptics one-by-one, so here are some links if you want to get more up-to-date LENR theory, research and technology. LENR is real. It's here. Deal with it.

MORE EDITS: 

[Here is an article with comments from Tom Darden on the report.](http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/techflash/2014/10/raleigh-investor-darden-still-bullish-on.html) Darden is CEO of of Cherokee Investment Partners, which founded Industrial Heat, the company that [bought the rights to the ECAT technology](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/industrial-heat-has-acquired-andrea-rossis-e-cat-technology-241853361.html) from Rossi for over 10mil (after due diligence). 

And [here is a press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/10/prweb12239416.htm) from the New Energy Foundation with a quote from a senior scientist at Nasa's Propulsion R&D, who says ""I was impressed with the work that was done to insure the measurements claiming a 3.2 to 3.6 COP were accurate. Aside from the fact that this could not have been produced from any known chemical reaction, the most significant finding to me is the evidence of isotopic shifts in lithium and nickel. Understanding this could possibly be the beginning of a whole new era in both material transmutations and energy for the planet and for space exploration. This is an exciting time to live in and this is an exciting technology to witness come about.""

Also, the report has apparently been submitted to Journal of Physics D for peer review; remains to be seen if it will pass scrutiny.  ",,6058

The thing is, no one knows the future.  We obviously don't know exactly what is going to happen.  But it is important to talk about emerging technologies, and what what the possible implications there so that we can best prepare for them.

33,ykvy5x,2022-11-03,Society,society,BandicootKind705,Why a Blue check mark is now $8 on Twitter and Elon Musk's Next Steps - A piece of speculative business non-fiction,"Is it likely Twitter is eventually going to be a paid service for everyone, at a price-point much less than $8?

Currently there are about 300K verified accounts on Twitter. The $8 fee would bring in a paltry 2.4million dollars every month - pocket change for a company with a 5 billion dollar annual revenue. So is the charge levied so eventually millions of people will buy the blue check mark for $8 a month - who would pay such a sum for a service like Twitter? I don't think that's the game here.

Elon's number 1 concern with Twitter has been to first make it free of spams and bots. But it doesnt make sense to charge money to blue check accounts if the aim is to reduce the number of spam accounts - the bot problem has never been with blue check accounts, which are more or less regulated in the public eye.

Well, perhaps the $8 charge is not supposed to bring in revenue, nor do away with the bot problem right now. Perhaps, all it is supposed to do at the moment is **create the idea first** among the general public **that Twitter is going to be a paid service.** **For everyone**. Obviously the charge for the general public later will not be $8. It will have to be much, much less, to the tune of a dollar per month or even less. After a section of Twitter has been paying $8 for a while, it will not seem too much for most of us to shell out a dollar a month. It will seem fair. So instead of making everyone pay at once at different tiers (which many wouldn't because right now it is given that Twitter is, and supposed to be, free), make it gradual. 

Charging everyone a minimum sub fee will help with the bot problem significantly, as one would have to shell out thousands or millions of dollar every month to keep spam operations going. It will also generate significant revenue for Twitter - if at least 250 million of Twitter's 450 million accounts currently are real, and at least a 100 million accounts stay after the subscription modality is introduced - that is still a 100 million dollars a month of clean revenue. That money can be used to pay content creators, and will pay for the regulation of spam accounts or actual hate speech, even more.

A win-win on both ends. Not sure if this is exactly what will happen, but speculative business non fiction is a fun genre!",,2297

Even in the so-called 'advanced countries', there are clearly a lot of people who may be able to use some aspects of the new tech, but are not exactly in the position to get much out of it.

Although so far the wealthy and powerful, the only people who can drive some part of humanity to the next level of civilization, have been able to keep the world masses quiet, there is a slight chance that they will lose, because there are always people like Urban of Hungary (who sold the cannons which could destroy Constantinople to the Turks) who would side with the masses for their own benefit.

If the masses win, the best and brightest lose and the advance of civilization stops.

Right now, the power of the unwashed masses is on their weight of numbers. It will be necessary to develop some kind of ideology that those with skills and ability to drive to the future are , well, different from those who can't, so the world could concentrate all of its energy to reach the next level of civilization (it may or may not be singularity, but if it is something the masses can't touch, that's good enough).

Otherwise the masses win and civilization falls to the level of the masses.",,1350

45,fqyd4v,2020-03-28,Discussion,discussion,One-Profit,My predictions on long-term societal changes after the COVID-19 pandemic,"I'll keep my points brief to avoid repeating arguments we've seen hashed out on this forum before. I'm interested in your comments.

**1/ The Cashless Society:** With paper money and coins being a vector for disease, we are seeing an increase of people paying with card. Cash is an outdated method of payment that belongs in the 20th century. The costs of creating, storing, transporting and counting physical currency are not worth it. The reduction in crime and tax evasion are bonuses. Society is already heading in the direction of the cashless society. This crisis will just help accelerate it. Countries like Sweden and China are already ahead of the curve.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
*Loss of privacy:* you either care about this or you don't. Personally speaking, I have nothing to hide. I don't care if the government knows I bought McDonalds three times in a week. Besides, so much of your shopping habits are already being tracked by grocery store loyalty cards and the Amazon algorithm.

*Charities will suffer:* There is nothing stopping generous people donating food and clothes directly instead of giving cash which may be mis-spent of drugs/alcohol. Even the beggar on the street in a third world country seems to have a smartphone these day. I'm sure he wouldn't refuse Venmo.

**2/ Working from home:** Now that many businesses' hands have been forced, we have learned that working from home *is* possible. It will be hard to justify making employees commute an hour to work when it's possible to complete their work at home. Bonuses include: Less overheads such as rent and electricity for businesses. Less traffic on the roads and therefore less pollution. Rise in quality of life for workers who no longer give up large parts of their day for free in pointless commutes.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
*I enjoy the social interaction with my coworkers and I feel more productive in the office:* This is a personal opinion. Perhaps working from home a few days a week could be made optional.

**3/ Reduction in the movement of people:** This is a political point so I expect some controversy, but this crisis has proven that strong borders are important. Free movement of goods can be allowed while greatly restricting the movement of people. The pipedream of free movement within the EU has taken a massive blow and I bet the Italians wish they had taken greater control of who they let into their homeland.

The airline industry in particular is getting hit hard and I predict the reduction in number of flights will linger long after this crisis has passed. There is no need for dozens of daily flights funneling Africans and Asians into Europe. Life can go on just fine if they stay in their part of the world and we stay in ours.

On the plus side, it's heart warming to see young Europeans helping out the elderly in our society by offering to pick up groceries in the shops for them. The kind of behavior you can expect to see (and that we used to see) in a homogeneous, high-trust society. Let's wind the clock back on this dangerous globalization nonsense.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
I am expecting a lot of knee-jerk hatred from the no-borders crowd but reality is not on your side.",,3250

Equally annoying - I've read some opinions that those that ""bought into"" BitCoin early deserve millions. 

Deserve...deserve...

Deserve is a strange choice of words. Especially because these sentiments often come from the same folks who hate(envy) those that ""bought into"" the Wall Street/Fed racket before 2008. Or those that ""bought into"" the housing boom early. Did my neighbor **deserve** to make 400,000 dollars in 2005 for simply buying a home in 2000?

BitCoin is making new highs every day - average hard working people who have not even heard of it yet (yes, they are still out there because there are too busy with their work or projects to notice financial news) will soon wake up and panic when they see this ship is taking off and they better do anything they can to get on - or miss it altogether. Just like the housing boom. They will lose time, effort, and resources out of fear of being left behind.

We are better than this. Aren't we tired of playing this same ol' game over and over? 

We don't need a cryptocurrency to move into the future. Our goal as a species should be to move away from ""money"" altogether.  We are better than this ""get rich by holding onto something rare"" mentality. We are so close to the Age of Abundance (Peter Diamandis), let's not squander this decade by building huge digital fortresses to protect our BitCoins - and then train cyber armies to pillage them.

Also, if BitCoin plays out the way many think - and if each coin is ""worth"" a billion or trillion dollars - do you think that the ""powers that be"" in today's economy will just happily give up their wealth? No, it will be a new Game of Thrones. This will eventually lead to panic, violence, and perhaps warfare. Not virtual warfare - real warfare. Already tremendous talent is being wasted to steal wallets and to hack exchanges instead folding proteins, extending lifespans, or improving battery efficiency. We're repeating the intellectual waste of the ""quants"" on Wall Street.

If you have extra ""money"" - instead of investing in gold, oil, BitCoin, or any other resource which has ""value"" only because it is limited - invest in companies and projects that are truly changing the world for the better. Not because it will make you rich - because it will feed the poorest of us, reverse environmental damage, and cure diseases.

Instead of using your computer to mine BitCoins - donate that processing time to science.

It seems that all we have done these past few weeks is to perpetuate greed. We've only shown the world that we (the tech-minded professionals as many of us on reddit are) are no better than the Robber Barons and Wall Street suits. It appears that instead of valiantly developing a Singularity outcome - we're pettily funneling a BitCoin income. We're playing the very game we were hoping to eliminate.

(mock Gekko speech) ""The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed -- for lack of a better word-- is NOT good.

Greed never works.

Greed corrupts, cuts down, and holds back our evolutionary spirit.

60,20fe9g,2014-03-14,text,text,josephbao,"Why capitalism is always the best choice, even in the future.","So, I was reading the submission about a binary future, one of Elysium, and the other of Star Trek.

Although everyone agreed that it would be best if our future was that of Star Treks, many proposed a sort of socialism as the way to get there, where people wouldn't have to work, they would just do what they loved, such as writing and art. The reason being was that technology is making everything so automated, that there would be no jobs left.

What made me chuckle is how all these futurology redditors were so idealistic, but backwards thinking. The moment we become a socialist society, is actually the moment any progress stops at all. Capitalism is the whole driving point of new technology. There will always be jobs, but these jobs will move from being mindless jobs that can be automated, to jobs that require creativity and thinking that robots can not and can never do.

In the future, if we all had a choice to do whatever we wanted, who would want to spend countless hours working on new technology, and working out all the nitty gritty details, when in the end, you wouldn't be rewarded at all for the great progress you made. You could have just went to go doodle, or make a painting, or watch TV or something. Who would maintain all the robots, who would heal the sick, who would do any hard job at all for absolutely no reward?

The real solution is capitalism. Not crony capitalism like we have now, but real capitalism. One without so many regulations that make it hard to enter a market. Capitalism pushes individuals to become entrepreneurs, who make the world a better place. Entrepreneurs are the ones who want to provide a better product or a lower price for the consumer. The government is the real evil, as lobbyists will pay off the government to stop entrepreneurs.

If you don't believe me, I dare you to go to angel.co and see what entrepreneurs are doing for the world. True capitalism is the key, socialism always sounds nice, but is never the solution.

edit:
The beauty of the free market is that companies compete on providing you the best/cheapest service. When it's hard for companies to enter the market due to regulations, such as the cable/internet market, the consumer gets screwed. But let's touch bases on another market that is more free, the electronics market. Every year we are getting better/cheaper electronics, as there are companies competing with each other for your dollar. That's why our technology has advanced so much faster than our broadband has.

My vision of true capitalism is when everyone is innovating to provide consumers with cheaper/better service and goods with minimal government regulation. Competition spurs better products/better services for people, and in the future will provide very cheap basic necessities, in which people will only have to work a few hours a month to obtain.

Automation allows companies to provide better/cheaper goods and services, and make them available to more people. For example, computers, smartphones, cars.

The problem with everyone thinking that we should become socialist after we have the technology to provide for everyone is that this technology will never ever exist if you told them that there wouldn't be money in the future.

Also, everyone's talking about Artificial Intelligence replacing humans. Who exactly is going to make this artificial intelligence if the society is socialist? That shit would be hard as hell, and there would be no reward for doing so.

edit:
I think that capitalism does have it's flaws, mainly stemming from monopolies, government intervention, and corporate lobbying, but socialism is DEFINITELY not a viable solution. For example, no one is going to spend countless hours studying and memorizing biological terms to get a medical school degree if they were rewarded the same as the guy who dropped out of school and smoked pot all day. No one would study for a test if they knew they would get the same grade as everyone else on the test. It's just not human nature. Capitalism is driven based on the flaws of human nature. Socialism believes that human nature doesn't have flaws.

I like how all the socialist on here are basically discounting the whole study of economics.

62,55b56x,2016-09-30,text,text,kulmthestatusquo,Are the Japanese showing how the people of future would behave?,"If the whole world were like Japan, we would already be traveling in the outer space by now.

Mankind should strive for more, bigger and better, and globalism, new world order, etc are the only ways to do that since that means harnessing the world's energy into one point, rather than engage in destructive and self-defeating internecine wars.

The Japanese appear to be showing the signs of the ideal people of the future.

Japan used to have its own share of dissidents and rebels, but by 1970s they were pushed to the margins of society. 

Japan is one of the few advanced countries which still has officially recognized pariahs (the Burakumin), and those who act 'out of the line' are treated like pariahs and are excluded from all social functions.

In addition, those who cannot maintain themselves are also allowed to fall off from the tracks - out of sight, out of mind. As a result Japan is very cold against charity - the attitude is that it was the person's fault.

In addition, Japanese culture is very , very individualistic and those who 'stick out' are punished.

As a result, those who can't get a decent job , or those who simply 'gave up', are stuck in their rooms, mostly playing online games, and stop being relevant.

In Japan, politicians and other plum positions are usually inherited - a relic from its long feudal era, which only ended on 1868 (and many of the new elites came from what we would call as 'knight' class, not lords but still people who could bear arms and lord over the peasants).

As a result, those who were not born in an elite family, or those who were at least not smart enough to enter the better universities, just tend to give up. 

Like most resource-poor societies, all resources are concentrated to those near the top. Elites live like just any other elites in the Western World, and those in good career track can afford to live affluently. However for the rest, there are not too much.

Younger people lose interest on relationship or even sex, let alone reproduction. They hardly care about politics, society, etc at all; the smarter ones have already left to play in the greener pasture, and the rest just live their lives out, doing not much.

Since most politicians get their positions from their parents, there are only fights among themselves; none of them will 'rock the vote'. People who used to do that are all dead, and now it is whose son beats whose daughter, that's it.

The yakuza and the underworld are violent but they know their is a 'firm line' they better not cross, so whatever happens there stays there, although if someone falls from the tracks they are fair game to these folks.

Like a giant centrifugal machine, Japan has separated its 'valuable' people from the rest, who will live their lives quietly, not reproducing and by staying at their room or working in menial jobs spending very little resources.

Plus the Japanese hate immigration so only very few people get to emigrate to there, usually whites who married a Japanese. (Japan accepts a few people of color, like the athlete in the last olympics with a Jamaican father and a Japanese mother, if they are 'judged to be beneficial'.)

Such static, changeless, progressless but at the same time technologically advancing and economically advanced, society is the model for future, which rewards those who are valuable, and will have enough for the rest to live on, as long as they 'walk in the line' and do not stray from the 'path' (and those who do not will be taken care by the yakuza or something like that).",,3549

Actually it looks kinda like its stagnating. I haven't seen any significant improvements in any technology that I can think of. I'm only 31 but in my lifetime the ONLY big change is in personal electronic devices: cellphones, smartphones, tablets, etc.

Where's the acceleration? How long have we been hearing about the wonders of regenerative medicine, quantum computers, and all this other futuristic stuff? How come the years go by, but the trickle of slow, steady, incremental advancements doesn't seem to change or get any faster? 

We're still nowhere near understand the human brain and how they work. We're still nowhere near creating an artificial intelligence. Biology is as complicated as ever. Drug discovery and development is actually slowing down. Advances in medicine are slowing down. Everywhere we look, we're hitting complexity limits. The huge, rapid advances of the 20th century were due to us picking low-hanging fruit, but all the low-hanging fruit has been picked. Now things are getting REALLY hard, and technology is starting to move much more slowly.

Where's all the ""exponential progress"" that everyone is so excited about? Years and years of ""breakthroughs"", but we can't even cure baldness, let alone aging. Years and years of predictions, yet the 2010s look pretty much like the 2000s, which looked like the '90s except for Youtube and Twitter and Facebook. In ten years, we may have some kind of limited VR, but that's about it. And VR is probably going to be a niche market, anyway. 

I think it's pretty telling that the vast majority of actual scientists don't buy into the Singularity. On the pro-Singularity side, who do you have? A bunch of entrepreneurs and bloggers, mostly. None of them are experts in computers, A.I., biotechnology, etc. And yet they'll tell you with confidence that we are on the verge of radical exponential change.

I bet we aren't. I bet in twenty years, we'll still be reading hyped up articles about some scientists putting stem cells into a rat and Oooooh it started walking normally again and maybe human trials will begin in another decade or so. Things are moving so slowly and I see NO indication that it's going to pick up soon. And yes, I know all about the big things happening in deep learning. But again, most actual AI scientists don't think those are anywhere near true AI. Watson and Siri will not usher in a Singularity or help accelerate progress, sadly.

Tl, dr:

These companies have cornered the market of the most high-IQ people on the earth.

Plus, the founders of these companies have learned from the Rockefellers, the Waltons, etc and set up their fortune in a way so their money will never be frittered away.

Unlike the Arab oil sheiks and Russian oligarchs, etc, who are not that smart but got lucky, these smartasses will make sure their fortunes will stay forever.

>high-IQ industries are much less sensitive to macro factors, are better managed, and have permanent market dominance and impassable moats (it’s much easier to make steel than it is to get 1/6 of the entire world population on your social network, or 95% of all major websites hosting your ads)

===

With the financialization of everything, not too many people will make good money, ever again.

And with the ascendance of huge landowners who don't give a shit about letting their properties vacant forever, 'cheap' housing in the desirable areas will never be back again and most people will be priced out from decent properties, once for all.

After all, the untouchables of India have been down and out for millennia, and will never see their days under the sun. Even if they are lucky enough to emigrate, higher-caste Indians will recognize them and make sure the social structure stays there.

These companies have cornered the market of high-IQ people who are the only ones capable of driving civilization. It is like the Chinese bureaucracy, which lasted a good 2,000 years until the English brought their ships to blast the Chinese mandarins in 1839.

Before 1839, the smartest people of China all went to Peking (or wherever the Emperor was at) to take lengthy and out-of-reach-for-poorer-people-because-the prep-cost-was-so-high tests, and became Mandarins. The Emperors came and went, but the Mandarins remained and served the masters, whether they were Chinese, Mongol or Manchrians. For Two Thousand Years. That's how powerful a concentrated system of higher-IQ people is.

Which means, their fortune will be there, forever, barring an alien invasion.

I described it before, but it is likely that the descendants of these people will marry noble families, political families and banking families, and enter into ""The Establishment"", like a Vanderbilt marrying the Duke of Marlborough (and the current Dukes are her descendants).",,2529

An example of this effect is self driving cars in traffic. Today all cars are driven by individuals, who rely mostly on incomplete information (mostly visual cues, some radio or gps data) and guessing (what is the car next to me going to do). It allows for a lot of cheating (drivers violating the rules) or abuse (cars with special permits and privileges, warranted or not). In the end you have a lot of accidents, cheating and traffic jams.

But if all cars were to be self driving, then they'd almost never have accidents, no one would be able to cheat and traffic jams would be a thing of the past.

An AI with total information awareness would be able to better develop rules, implement them and enforce them. It would be very hard to corrupt, and if using something like blockchain then every action it takes would be visible to everyone, allowing for full public scrutiny.

This would be a good thing as we'd have a much more fair society, with better rules and no abuse by those in power. Everyone would truly have equal chances and be equally reward for their contributions to society.",,1241
126,rfew29,2021-12-13,Transport,transport,RecycleForGaia,An alternative to faster-than-light travel,"Well even if we can't travel faster-than-light we might be able to turn into light itself. If you did not already know, it is possible to synthesize metals through nuclear transmutation. By changing the number of protons, neutrons or electrons in the atoms of one type of element, they can be transmuted into the atoms of another element. Currently this can be done with particle accelerators and nuclear reactors, but I think we are only capable of doing it at the atomic level and have not yet created a way to transmute one material to another in bulk, since too much energy is required. The photons of light are not made out of protons, neutrons or electrons, but according to string theory, everything is made of what in quantum mechanics are called strings. So, this could mean that both photons and atoms are made of strings, therefore if we found a way to manipulate strings, we might be able to turn atoms into photons. I read somewhere that all we would need to be able to detect strings are much bigger particle accelerators with much more energy. While we do not have enough room on Earth to make them, a hypothetical future civilization in space could. Then we might be able to accelerate the strings like we do to other particles or do something similar and thus be able to transmute physical things made of atoms into light. So, maybe we could have two giant particle accelerators on different planets that are great distances apart, then beam light that was transmuted from something physical from one planet to the other, which would be collected in the other particle accelerator and turned into something physical again. Yes, I know we would need to travel to the other planet in the first place to build the particle accelerator on it, but doing something like this could save us the time of making several trips. Though it might only work with transporting supplies because I do not know if any living thing could survive being transmuted at the subatomic level.",,1983
127,enmxul,2020-01-12,Space,space,DanteLeo24,"The way I see it, the Femi Paradox is fundamentally flawed.","Furthermore, it is why I defend the idea that technological advancement cannot be guided solely by physicists, chemists, engineers and the like.

The Fermi Paradox relies on the idea that in the observable universe, technological advancement is a goal that every - hypothetically - existing species strives for. That NEEDS that to be an objective and absolute truth, otherwise it all falls apart.

Even within human history, that ideal is not universal, the Native American nations, in the North and the South (specially in South America), weren't on the same technological level of the Europeans because they were idiots or incapable, but because their environment and social/cultural mindset didn't led them down that path like it led on the western world. The same could be said of Sub Saharan Africa and the Oceanian nations.

The, so called, Scientific Revolution developed itself in the western world during the height of colonialism and imperialism and even to this day it is the West and western ideals that lead Scientific research. This lack of historical, sociological, philosophical and anthropological conscience is why anytime that an astrophysicist stumbles blindly on philosophical grounds (as is the case of the Fermi Paradox) they come up with fundamentally flawed logic. This is way intertextuality is vital for technological advancement and why the humanities MUST ALSO be in the vanguard of scientific thought.

To summarize, the reason that I believe that the Fermi Paradox is flawed, is because it assumes that Western ideals and scientific drive is so objectively modern, absolute, superior and INEVITABLE that it extends across the whole universe; while, in truth, it just might be that, in our westernized world, we are the only ones hollow and unsatisfied enough to look at the stars and say: I NEED to get there.",,1840

In places like San Paulo,  there are places where the homeless and the poor do not f'k around. The police make sure the important areas are NOT plagued by people who do not belong there.

There are quite a lot of higher-income people who are not pleased to see people down their luck. Just by looking at them brings bad feelings and possibly bad karma.

So the civilization builders would rather not see the eyesores.

Like the enclosure movement where the landowners simply drove the tenants to the street and killed those who didn't want to move, the richer civilization drivers want their cities free of miscreants and eyesores, and sooner or later the police and authorities will side with the richer people since they pay these agency's salaries.

Again, Gregory Clark has definitely proved that everyone in England, sans more recent immigrants, has been descended from the more successful farmers/merchants (the nobles were too few to matter) , and the genes of the peasants, artisans, servants, soldiers, etc have been all weeded out by the 'capitalist genes'.

I have said a few times that a rich-poor war will begin, with the poor driven by sheer desperation to rebel, and the rich and their allies mowing them down with a glee.

It will probably not be an all-out war - it will be long-drawn, locale-by-locale affair, but the poor have no edge because of their lack of tech advances.

129,2esvjx,2014-08-27,text,text,Quasi_Pro,Why we should not kill to eat!,"I come from a background of meat eaters, most of us probably do. My father is a German butcher my great grand father was a turkey farmer for a large part of his life, and I was born in Texas, don't get me wrong I loved eating a good burger every now and then, and for a long time we as a species needed to eat meat to survive, often it was all we had.

But now in this age with a few exceptions, it is a fact that  we don't need to eat meat to survive, and the truth is that its not even sustainable, if the rest of the world were to eat meat the way we do in america and Europe, we would need multiple earths to sustain that level of consumption, and we are already in trouble when it comes to meeting the demands of the world today. I am not looking at this from that perspective though, even though that is a huge issue all by itself, I look at this from more of an altruistic point of view, most everyone who interacts with animals would agree that they are sentient, and show different levels of consciousness, have their own social structures, etc...We just got really lucky and are on a much higher level of consciousness, and do to that luck we are now outside of the food chain, I do understand that in  parts of the world people still need to eat meat to survive but I think that by the end of this century we will see a drastic reduction in people eating meat from animals that we had to kill, and eventually it will be looked down upon and even become a crime for a human to kill a living being(with exceptions to where someone needed to do so to survive)  and people will gradually move more towards eating artificially produced meats that are grown in a sustainable way in bioreactors. In fact I think its our responsibility to do this.

We are not alone in this universe! We have all the these other living creatures living on this planet with us, and if you think about it, seeing as we evolved in to what we are today, putting our flaws as a species aside for second, is it really that hard to imagine that just maybe another spices could evolve to become similar to what we are, I don't think its that much of a stretch at all!

That is why I am a vegetarian now! Anyway just a thought, i hope you guys liked it, and maybe agree with my point of view, or not.",,2277

164,9vacc9,2018-11-08,Discussion,discussion,izumi3682,Russia is back. Probably big time. And they want a (big) piece of the 21st century technology pie. Also they're Russians.,"Russia, immediately post Soviet Union, went through an extraordinarily bad time.  At some points in the last, nearly 30 years, it has been relegated to near irrelevancy. But in the last ten years, it has been noticeably ascending once more. Testing the waters with Gazprom control and that Ossetia and Crimea business. We would also do well to remember that Russia has by a slight edge the most nuclear weapons of *anybody*, in case any of you are too young to be familiar with the ""Cold War"".

Just like China has a different way of viewing humanity, so too does Russia. A sentiment that Czarina Alexandra pithily expressed when she said; "" Russia loves to feel the whip, it's their nature."" And this was demonstrated by their military organization as well. In the first world war, yes, but particularly during ""The Great Patriotic War"" (WWII to us). The higher echelon officers like generals and field marshals were ruthlessly purged to ensure loyalty through stark fear. The lower ranks to include lower ranking officers, under the rank of colonel I mean, had virtually no initiative training. They were trained to carry out the orders of the commanding officers to the letter, regardless of circumstances.  The goal being that the lower ranking officers wouldn't get any uppity ideas.  During the second world war, if an officer was killed--that unit was in big trouble. Nobody would know what to do. Not to mention NKVD *political* officers that accompanied the troops and liberally shot anyone who wavered or was potentially mutinous. This included talk that was deviant of state ideology or the party line. This manner of military discipline continued through the entirety of the ""Cold War"" era. I don't know how much the military has changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. But I see signs that it is still much the same in ideology. It's not a good idea to be too smart for your own good.




And that is another reason that Russia is the way Russia is. Russia has always operated by people crudely, but effectively, bossing other people around. First with the royal government bossing around the *actual* 20th century serfs--people with technology and culture virtually unchanged from the middle ages. And then with the Soviets bossing around the ""Worker's Paradise"" serfs and now with this so-called presidency which is really a sort of ""oligarchy"" of powerful and cooperating rich people. I think today's Russia is the closest thing to a country governed by organized crime. If you cause trouble you get whacked. And they're real specific and pointed about it. They don't try to hide it like say, China (PRC). Back in the Soviet day, the person went to a ""psychiatric hospital"" and ""passed away"". Now they are assaulted by ""criminals unknown"" in broad daylight. But the Russian people *love* Putin and his government and do *not* care what anybody else thinks. Make no mistake, they are damn proud of their international re-assertion. So it is a Russian way of thinking.


I want to make another super important point about Russia. Russia nearly singlehandedly destroyed the military of the Third Reich. Russia absorbed the German invasion and sacrificed nearly 20 *million* civilians and 7 *million* military individuals. All dead. The wounded casualties are uncounted. The Soviet Union in turned killed 4 *million* German military. These are facts that are not well known in the USA, the West or in China (PRC). But they should be. Yes the USA and the Allies gave the Soviets the equipment they needed because they (The USA and the Allies) understood the incomparable imperative of wiping Hitler out, but it was Russian blood that paid that price. The remainder of the German military in Western Europe made it comparatively simple to defeat. We thought we had it bad in Italy. We had no concept of what ""bad""  was. In the entirety of WW2 the number of USA military dead was about a hair over 400,000. 

Well I said all that to make the point that it is time we recognize that Russia is a viable and potentially very dangerous player on the world stage once again. If they can have the capability and audacity to truly influence a USA presidential election. If they have the chutzpah to reach right over to England and poison former Soviet operatives to shut them up (and apparently be unconcerned with collateral damage)--then Russia is powerful once more.

And the Russians are sneaky and deceptive. They actually have a word for this cultural ideology--""Maskirova"". The idea of keeping your true intentions close to the vest and misleading everyone to think that they know your intentions. You want them to think one thing, while you are busy with something else...

Russia's ""Soviet"" style propaganda machine does not even try to hide *it's* intentions either. ""RT"" (Russia Today) is proof of that. RT is meant to take a given countries flaws and exploit them to cause dissension, discord and instability in that country. I don't even know why they want to *do* that anymore. I think some Soviet habits just die hard. Whenever I see a RT video on Youtube, I'm like; ""tsk! Soviet, I mean *Russian* propaganda...""

*Now* Russia wants the same thing that the USA and China (PRC) want. A piece of the ARA (AI, robotics and automation) pie. And not just ARA. I note with interest that Russia seems to be a hot bed for human longevity research money. At first I discounted this because I felt that Russia was, well, too low-life, shifty and technically backward to be able to do such things. But when I saw their bipedal robot a year or two back. I realized that Russia is back. In the scariest way you can imagine. Scatter minded and messily disorganized, but clumsily powerful. And they are quickly focusing again. Putin himself stated that the country that controls AI will control the world.


Oh and about their space program. As blocky and hamfisted as *it* is, it is undeniable proof that the Russians are dogged *masters*, bar none, of the spit and bailing wire ""workaround"" (acknowledging the miracle that was the USA's ""Apollo 13"" save). They are *born* brute force technicians. Sure, somebody occasionally falls right out of space to the ground. But that don't phase 'em.  And when something like that *does* happen, they don't tend to *advertise* it.  And right now the USA, and everybody else, I think, is using their workhorse ships to get people around in space. If the price is right, Russians can be pretty darn dependable.


If Russia says they can put a colony of robot avatars on the moon, which by the way I think is a *brilliant* idea, I don't doubt that they can. And, I bet, sooner than you think. The Russians are *very* good at persevering and pushing through. Just ask the Germans.",,6724

188,e4xbvd,2019-12-02,Environment,environment,SylvineKiwi,Technology is not the magical solution,"I'm going to keep it short, I'm not an expert (and I won't even bother providing sources, you are as qualified as me to use google), and I'm not a climate-skeptic nor a collapsist.

But I'm seeing way too many people being overly optimistic about the ability of technology to ""save us"".

The problem is that ""saving us"" is vague, and I have the feeling that in a lot of people mind, it means keep living the exact same way, but your car will be electrical and will be powered by nuclear energy (or something like that).

Two things.

First, just look at lists of the most polluting things. It will depend on the study and how they measure it, but at the top of these lists you always find the same thing, like agriculture (mainly meat), fashion industry or shit like that. Things that have literally been around since civilization existed.

Even if all trucks and boats were electrical, it would be still be very polluting for everyone to eat meat every single day.

And yeah, I'm sure we will all be eating lab-grown meat soon, it doesn't matter because of point two : The rebound effect.

Basically computer are 1000 times less polluting than 50 years ago, but now everyone has one in their pocket.

It doesn't matter what ground breaking technology we will be able to discover, in an ultra-capitalist world the outcome will be the same : if it's twice less pollutant (and so probably twice cheaper) to produce something, they are going to produce it 4 times more.

Autonomous electric cars ? People are just going to live even farther from their job.

Not to mention we are more and more on the planet, so anything that become cheaper gets immediately adopted by waaay more people.

The solution to our problem is both simple and hard, it doesn't need any additional technology. In fact it would be better with less, what we need is simply to ""consume"" less stuff (and I think it's fitting to talk about it just after this black friday nonsense).

And I'm not saying individual people should take it on themselves, the only solution is a political one.

Also to be clear, I'm not saying we shouldn't be chasing more efficient technologies, but we shouldn't be reliant on it (not to mention progress could be way slower or less impressive than what we imagined).

**EDIT** : Getting a lot of replies from people that probably just read the title and jump to the comment section to post something like ""YOU WISH WE WERE BACK TO THE TIME WERE A SIMPLE COLD COULD KILL YOU ?§§§§§""

So I'm paraphrasing my whole message in a simple bit size conclusion that is hopefully short enough for the average reddit user attention span : 

TECHNOLOGY **ALONE** CAN'T SAVE US

THAT'S DOESN'T MEAN TECHNOLOGY IS INHERENTLY BAD, JUST THAT WAITING FOR SOME HYPOTHETICAL MIRACLE INNOVATION TO REVERSE THE EFFECT OF HUMAN POLLUTION IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY GREED, AND NO AMOUNT OF SCIENCE CAN REMOVE IT",,2904

We can observe exponential growth of their energy consumption, worsening shortages of electronics, simultaneously these cult-like societies are growing in power/influence, can buy politicians (e.g. El Salvador) … further taking control of chip manufacturers and power plants, in a few years growing to 50%, 90%, 99% of world energy production?

Can such positive feedback be always balanced at a reasonable level, instead of approaching 100% of resources of civilization?

224,zc5duf,2022-12-04,AI,ai,earlofcuntembury,Brain computer interface / Neuralink,"Right now it seems, there's going to be 2 kinds of BMI's, the ones that go inside the skull (cranium) and is attached to the brain directly, with connectors thinner than hair. The other one is outside the skull and works with LED light thru the cranium. The inside cranium - version is installed by a robot. 

First BCI's would be used to control computers. Mobile devices belong to this category. But when one ponders the prospects of Neuralink and other devices of it's kind, many more ideas surface.

Like Android/Iphone Neuralink could have apps. It will have an API, programming interface. Which means third party companies are able to develop their own software for the BCI'S! There could be a new section in Gplay store, dedicated to this new wave hardware.

Interfaces like Neuralink have the ability to both read and write in the brain. The leader of the Neuralink project Shivon Zilis said, it's all just electric signals going back and forth, you just need to find the correct places to connect to. 

If one ponders this, there could be some really cool apps. This is just a list of ideas I have, hope other ppl can add to this... :

 meditation app, to empty the mind of thoughts. Most people have minds that race all the time, watching movies/series makes this worse, since that person never spends any time with his own mind. This app could suppress or fade away these distracting thoughts. One would be able to spend time without thoughts, so even the body could rest and get better, since too much thinking gets in the way of healing. 

 Messaging via thoughts. At first one would use computers for messaging, just like you use your phone now, but the phone would not have touch screen, the whole user interface would be controlled by thinking. Later the interface would move inside the cranium completely. Since we would have the ability to send visuals and sound directly to the brain! This is far in the future, but I think it's a realistic prospect.

 Work enviroment. All the computers would be Neuralink/BCI controlled. It would be a lot faster way to work. Even machines like aeroplanes, excavators, loaders and cranes could have this interface, with safety protocols implemented. This would create jobs that require the employee to have a brain machine interface installed in order to get hired.

 Games! Lol, imagine controlling your fav titles with your thoughts. Later, perhaps, directly in to your visual and audial cortex, just like in the Matrix.

 Spotify in the brain.

 Dating apps. You could allow the BMI software to scan your thoughts and thought patterns for a few weeks 24/7 and then enter your ""deep thought"" dating profile to an dating app. This way it would be possible literally to find your soulmate, no matter where he/she is located at, no country restrictions!

 The arousal app. If a person has ""hard time"" with getting things down there to act accordingly, this app could offer some assistance. It could work in various ways. Like stimulating the brain with certain kinds of thought patterns, even customised ones. This would lead to a revolution in the Pr0n industry. 

 Brand new language! People with these interfaces could develop a new way of communication, an internet language. It would be universal, no matter what country you are from. No more learning of complex age old languages, just one way of mind chatting via the thought speak. Or Thospe for short. 

 Mind matters app. It would make thought profiles, a bit like the dating app. But this could be used to profile convicted criminals, who have committed serious crimes or have a long history of criminal activity. The court could make a decision to send this criminal for a Mind Matters evaluation and profiling session. Remember, some of the interfaces attach outside the cranium. Detectives could use this kind of mind databases to predict and prevent criminal activity.

 Thought controlled drones for the Ukraine army! 

You could drive your car by thinking. This would require some training and getting used to. New cars that support BCI's natively are needed. New traffic laws are needed. Very complex thing to go thru, takes years!

 Think with your pet app. You could train yourself and your dog to think alike! You could ""hear"" your dogs thoughts in your mind. Give commands and tell him he's a good boy, great mind bonding. A new era of man's best friend. Not for guinea pigs! 

 Concetrated thoughts app. You can be working, driving, doing sports, home work or just walking in the woods. Concetrated thoughts brings your attention to what you are doing, it fades out other distracting thoughts that slow you down or make you less efficient. Getting this done correctly and in a way that advances your skills, can have a nice boosting effect on self esteem also!

 Adblock for the benefit of your precious brain by Raymond Hill. Save your gray cells from the poisons of the big G.

 Open source and Linux! The open source community could later on develop their own non-corporate dependant version. You can be 100% sure your thought data stays with you, until you choose to share some of it. 

If you have ideas for apps, please continue this list of the future. I have more detailed ideas and some other ones that I will preserve for the days to come!",,5275

  Every situation that involves the taking of human life through inaction of a self driving car in normal operation is reasonable and burdens not the car but the people who mis-used the road.  
  
  A self driving car should never be forced to ""swerve"" to avoid a pedestrian this killing the driver or less pedestrians. At all times the vehicle must follow the law and use it's breaks. If there is not enough time to stop before hitting the pedestrians then they will die. This is not.al and expected because they were breaking the law anyway.  
  
  I don't care if a million black underprivileged immigrant babies could be saved by swerving and killing the passenger. They were in the wrong to be using the road in an illegal fashion and will pay the price. There is no big dilemma regarding how autonomous vehicles should be programmed. If we use the existing laws everything else will figure itself out. If a pedestrian jumps out in front of a car well have fun in heaven because that's where you belong, not the passengers.  
  
  You might think I'm cruel in suggesting this but compared to the alternative, (vehicles that decide when to break laws to kill it's passengers), I'd say my idea is the only sane one that has been proposed. Autonomous vehicles do not have a moral decision to make. They are like robotic arm in a factory. If someone gets in the way and dies then it's the person's fault, not the machine.

245,721m4n,2017-09-23,AI,ai,virnovus,"Sorry Ray Kurzweil, but the Singularity seems to have been put on hiatus","Disclaimer: the following was written after watching a video on Ray Kurzweil, and then trying to articulate what I disliked so much about it:

I recently sat through a video about Ray Kurzweil at the insistence of a friend.  I kind of remembered who he was at the beginning of the video, but seemed to have suppressed a lot of emotions regarding the man, and I had the feeling that most of those emotions were negative.  After nearly biting my tongue off during the video, I remembered why:  From everything I've heard about him, he's a skilled but egotistical electrical engineer that doesn't know anything at all about nanotech and talks about it like it's magic. There's a reason that he spends all his time these days TALKING about nanotechnology rather than actually working on it though: he wouldn't know where to begin, so he's trying to get other people to work on it. Since he wants to be immortal, he thinks that if he can just promote this type of research enough, he can achieve his goals. He'll die with a normal human lifespan though, I guarantee it. The year 2030 (when he predicts this technology will become available) is 100% wishful thinking on his part, and was calculated based on the fact that he wants to be alive to see it (and thus use it to attain immortality) rather than any real numbers that make any sense.

One problem with his thinking is that he still hasn't learned the lesson that economists learned back in 1929: exponential growth never continues forever. It may hold true over periods of years or decades, but eventually, it hits some hard limit. For instance, Moore's law, which is the most well-known exponential formula applied to technological development, can't hold true forever, if only because devices (transistors in this case) can never become smaller than an atom. But because Ray Kurzweil has successfully predicted technological development in the past based on an assumption of exponential improvement, (he'd begin a project before the technology for it all existed, using an exponential model to predict when it would become available) he seems to think that he can make any wild extrapolation he can think of, using the same exponential model.

Using nothing but exponential models to predict technological improvements, ends up resulting in a weird phenomenon called ""The Singularity"", which I personally don't buy into at all. Reason being, it ascribes human-like intelligence to AI, but then totally ignores the means through which mammalian intelligence develops and assumes that that part isn't necessary. Basically, the most intelligent mammals are the ones with the longest childhoods. For this purpose, we can assume that ""childhood"" is the length of time between birth and reproduction, and is primarily a period of learning. Humans, of course, have ridiculously long childhoods, which is a major evolutionary detriment. This sort of thing wouldn't evolve unless there was an enormous upside to counterbalance it, which of course, there is. That being, the many benefits of the technology and global society that our species' intelligence has allowed us to develop.

In essence, what Ray fails to realize is that a computer can't learn just by sitting there being smart. Neither can a human, for that matter. Learning requires interacting with the universe via a lengthy process of trial and error. It also requires the ability to sort out correct and incorrect information, when sifting through all the data collected by other sources that's accessible to it. Since a combination of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and chaos theory preclude perfect predictions in our universe, that means that there's no getting around the learning process for an AI, and also that an AI will need to use probability as a means of predicting events. The alternative to using probability is being ""so smart that it can predict everything perfectly"", which all the especially obnoxious futurists seem to believe is going to become the case.

But what does AI have to do with nanotech? As it turns out, everything. You see, Ray Kurzweil has made a particularly egregious leap of faith: because of the enormous complexity involved, people will need to develop AI with god-like abilities in order to then develop the nanotech that Ray so desperately wants to believe will be available before he reaches the end of his natural lifespan. Of course, this involves no small amount of speculation, that assumes that artificial intelligence and biological intelligence are both scalar quantities, and thus have the ability to increase exponentially. After all, anything that isn't a scalar, can't fit that exponential model that Ray is so fond of, and he really, *really* wants it to fit. If it didn't, then Ray's extrapolations would fall apart and he'd have to die eventually like every other human being that's ever lived.

Also, Ray Kurzweil regularly throws around phrases like ""ten times as intelligent as a human"" as though intelligence is a scalar quantity and can be measured like this. Think of it this way: if I said you were 276 times as intelligent as a gopher, where would that number be coming from? Likewise, describing a theoretical AI as being ten times as intelligent as a human sounds just as ridiculous.

The real thing that bugs me about Ray Kurzweil though, is his total inability to understand why people disagree with him. At one point, he was on a radio show, and a caller described him as a quasi-religious idiot with his head in the clouds. His response was something along the lines of ""some people just really seem to have a hard time accepting that this is what the future is going to be like soon."" No Ray, I think you have it backwards. *One* person is having a very tough time accepting that this *isn't* what things are going to be like any time soon.

I'll see you in 2030.",,5849

""Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar"", every ""supreme leader"", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. 

There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another. ""

We as a community need to look forward into the challenges of the future and prepare ourselves for the coming revolution in AI and Robot Automation. In the ""distant"" future, some form of Basic Income will be a given. 99%  - of all other possible futures are usually dystopian. The question is how can we afford it.

Automation and machine learning - Its already here, its global and no-one has any clue what direction its going. Yet we can't have a discussion on how to keep society evolving and not stagnating? 

I understand that some are diametrically opposed to the idea of Wealth Distribution. However, Stifling debate and removing All references to Basic Income is only going to make the matter worse for both parties. 

Some very Vocal minority of The Pro UBI community is convinced there is a corporate and Governmental conspiracy to keep UBI out of the Media spotlight, considering the productivity and profits of both these entities it's not hard to accept as true when looking at the long term evidence against any ideas of Wealth distribution, the drug wars, private prisons and so on. 

Meanwhile there are some seriously salty Anti-UBI who claim that this is clearly just a generational thing and turning into a Millennials Vs Boomers Argument.

Clearly we need MORE discussion on this topic - as many haven't been given enough time to clearly understand the others position. To moderate the Subreddit around a single topic is to convince them its not worthy of attention or debate.

I shouldn’t have made the mistake of watching old commercials on YouTube, because I compare this year’s commercials to those, but even if I hadn’t, I’d still notice.  First, I’ll describe some of those ads from the ‘90s to show how technologically forward-thinking they were, how they advertised things that were ahead of their time, that I didn’t even know they had then.  In late 1992, a voice-activated car phone!  A 1993 Magnavox ad concerning... unbelievably, a remote-like device with a screen that could actually type what you say by voice recognition, like you’d say, “record this show at 10:00, and then you put this near the VCR and it instructs the VCR to record the show!  You see what I mean?  What?  Homelink, whereby the lights would automatically switch on in one’s house when their car approached, in a mid-1995 commercial!  You see?  Now, let’s compare that to this year’s commercials.  There are multiple truly innovative things that I read about over two years ago now, that they STILL say nothing about!  Smartphone control of appliances, voice control of appliances!  WHERE IS IT?  They said they were making countless devices with Alexa and Google Home recognition in 2019, over two years ago!  What of progress?!  What of the magic of technological device innovation, where the true innovation is!  What of being able to say, “Back in my day, we didn’t have this snazzy stuff.  We’ve come a long way!”  Don’t you care about that?  These ads..  Turn the page, the future, new era!  No, no, no.  Instead, this!

For one example, Google, a tech company with all this state-of-the-art technology.  What do they show in their ads?  How about searching Google to buy CANDLES!  AND... drum roll... a Turn Table!!  @#$#@#$#@  Of course!  EVERYone just loves those fantastic turn tables now in 2021!!!  So Google, instead of EVER talking about their smart display anymore, which itself can play music, encourages people to reject innovative devices and re-adopt anachronistic technology.!  Come on people.  Why are they so scornful and opposed to true innovation, to entirely new revolutionary capabilities like voice control of appliances and so forth.  No, turn tables!  Seeing all these turn tables and records in commercials is maddening,  I can’t take any more!  That was outdated by 1980, if not even earlier, 42+ years ago, and yet all these people younger even than that have re-adopted it!  That’s a great example of what I’m talking about.  Touch of Modern .com always showing that turn table.  So turn tables are modern I guess!  THAT’s what they showcase.  “modern”!  Turn Tables!  Always with the turn tables!!!!  Please.. please stop.  Is it 1900?  What about smart displays!  Google won’t even advertise its own technology!

Dinosaur eye-sore CRT TVs shown in commercials, Sprite!, IMDB, etc., dinosaur eye-sore cassette stereos as old as the aforementioned TVs in too many commercials, one is too many, let alone that many!  Intentionally making ads look like they’re on Super 8 film!  Famous Footwear, more.  STOP.  IT. NOW!!!  That one’s kind of new.  They’ll probably have to ridiculously predictably and maddeningly do more like that even in 2022!  Don’t follow the stupid infuriating trend for once!  NO MORE of that!  Yeah yeah, go ahead. Argh!  Super 8 film!  Of course!  You see what I mean?  Outrageous.  NOT in 2022!!!!  Just watch, you’ll see.  As if the picture resolution weren’t already bad enough.  They have 8k now, yet they’re making commercials look like they’re on Super 8 film!  And look at Licorice Pizza!  It’s set in the early ‘70s and look at how poor the picture resolution is!  And that’s another thing.  At least 70% of the movies this year have been set at least 3.5 decades ago!  There are still many more examples, but I think that‘s enough.",,3848

The next level of tech social activism imo will be 'shadow editing'.  The basics of how I see this working:

UserA posts something outside of an accepted activist narrative.  Similar to shadow banning, UserA will see their own 'wrong think' post.  For the sake of argument, we'll use this as an example post:""I just don't buy it, climate change is not caused by humans""

UserB, a friend of UserA visits his socials and sees that UserA posted.  UserB is also a climate skeptic, but UserA's post has been shadow edited.  Now UserB sees the following post from UserA:""I'm starting to come around to this climate change stuff, I think it may be caused by humans""

UserA is unaware this is what his friend UserB is now viewing.  The system is smart enough to know there is 95-99%% probability UserB will see the post and not interact.  If the system knows UserA and UserB are often in off-line communication, the system will not shadow edit.  Shadow editing only needs to occur a very small percentage to have global ideological influence.  In other words, the low hanging fruit will be what is shadow edited.  This could be especially effective on a platform like Twitter, where the majority simply 'look' at content and scroll through it, the replies are also rarely read by the original poster.

If for some reason UserB decides to confront UserA over their shadow edited statement, the system will perform a shadow edited conversation until its conclusion, likely steering the discussion into a hole.  UserA and UserB will both be seeing shadow edits as they converse.  In some cases this could go multiple levels deep.  UserA and UserB see one fake conversation among themselves and the users outside of this see even another edited conversation.

Challenges:  The system needs to be fairly unified among big tech companies.  A system would need to be in place which can track the shadow edit through possible multiple platforms.  It may need to keep the edits going across facebook, twitter, chats and even emails.  There will be terms of service changes to ensure when shadow edits are discovered that people accept it as a common good and part of the 'hate speech mechanisms', hate speech of course being whatever the big tech companies disagree with.  They will likely not call it 'shadow editing', it would be called something like, 'corrective speech pattern logistics' or something silly.

Dystopian nightmare:  It will be close to impossible for anyone to fight this as detractors will simply be shadow edited to make it look like they support the system!  As the populace becomes more and more apathetic to all things, they find no motivation to fight it.  They descend further into their media consumption psychosis and big tech achieves full compliance of the human race.",,2888

297,5vp1kk,2017-02-22,Society,society,kulmthestatusquo,Not many people will be able to survive the future transition,"The world has become IQ-oriented, rich-dominated and merit-centered.

There is no more room for the ""Average"", as expressed by Tyler Cowen.

The financialization of the economy has ensured that there will never be any responsibility borne by today's winners, and any losses will be socialized.

With ever-increasing values of stock and property, most people will be priced out from their abodes and will be housed in tenements or sleep in the streets, where they will be fair game to trigger happy policemen or just some rich kids having fun.

It does not help that most jobs will be automated away so there will not be any chance for those who can't program robots to earn any kind of living.

Today's social positions have become almost permanent and eternal, and future tech will only widen the gap between the 'selected' and the rest, like light and day.

Eventually, as mankind learns to harness the resource and energy of space, the power, wealth and reach of the 'selected' will be virtually limitless, while the rest will probably be quietly led to extinction.

I personally think the number of people who will enjoy the transition to the new civilization, with singularity, transhumanism and all that, might be about 10 million.

If we fail to reach such great goals, today's civilization is still sustainable with 800 million people, which is twice the population of the Civilized World before the Great War when a lot of land were still undeveloped.

Only the richer, the smarter and the more inimical will survive since their genes are superior and are more suited to drive the future, and the rest will be flushed down into the toilet of evolution.",,1661

Capitalism is based on the tension created by scarcity on offer and demand, it's based on a scarce physical world full of constraints against the limited human nature but, what about a posthuman world where our minds can be connected to the Metaverse and the hardware needed to maintain it is cheaper and cheaper, and more abundant?

I think Communism will return but only for this kind of physical world where unity and coordination is required for full optimisation of production. On the other hand we willl keep Capitalism for intellectual property, creativity, imagination, VR goods etc. 

Of course there will be limitations in the physical world so some things will become scarce like computing power, but this scarcity will be so limited to a few products things that it will not save physical capitalism because we will just need sand to keep computing power/capacity growing. It's just a good, or more, but just raw materials, atoms, easy to manipulate etc.

This may sound stupid and maybe it is, but consider we are moving towards the world of ideas, from it to bit, and matter becomes more and more cheaper while knowledge is what gives products its price.

•	I’m not interested in relationships, I don’t go out on dates nor do I want to commit to a relationship.

•	The banking employee system rewards people which bring in the most people to the company and disbands poor working employees, call me crazy but I think I’d thrive in that system.

All the wars, destructions, etc only occur in bush league countries where no civilized people would be found dead.

Everything is so efficient, so effective and so prompt that there is no room for a slack, which had been exploited by so many people from lower social ranks to raise themselves.

There is no more room to do so anymore.

Today's upper class will be forever. They will be the upper class of the Local Group soon when space is conquered, etc. David Wingrove already talked about it in his Chung Kuo series.

There is simply no way for the rest to overturn the structure, because today's elites have a tech, financial and military advantage which the hoi polloi can't even dream about catching up.

In some sense, the Singularity has already arrived for the Elites.

When we reach the next level of Civilization, the Elites will become gods by transhumanism and other enhancements unthinkable today, leaving the rest to share the path of Ishi, the last Yahi. The elites will conquer the space, while the two-legged apes will be left to rot in a radioactive, dying earth.

People who know where the world is going know this is the only path remaining. The other available path, if tech is developed too late, is the world running out of critical resources and falling into eternal chaos, but I predict a massive enclosure to deny the poorer people from resources, which would reduce pop to maybe 100m-1000m (anyone's guess), which will buy at least one more century.",,1545

Same reason 19th century colonialism, with Leopold Ii and all that, was justified.

The fact is that Congo was a better place during Leopold II's rule than now.

If Chuck Fitzclarence and his foolish 200 Worcester men did not stop the Germans at Gheluvalt in Oct 28, 1914 (and he and most of them died within 7 days of their foolish act, the most idiotic act of Western Civilization of all time) and prolong the Great War by 4 years,

the disenfranchisement , concentration and exploitation of the colonials would have been completed. The  colonials would have followed the fate of the Tasmanians, being worked to death, denied all properties, and denied all modern medicine and other joys of advanced world.

I said that if Chuck did not order that stupid charge, 7 million European youths would have been spared, to develop higher tech and all that, and we would have had Singularity by 2000, although the Colonials (= Third Worlders) would not have liked it too much. In that scenario the pop  ratio of the civilized people vs the uncivilized people would have settled near 10:1, not the other way around as now. With the whole world under Western (and Japanese) domination, there would have been no need to fight a cold war and feed the third worlders.

No need to cry for these people - it is Social Darwinism, the virtues of which are only being relearned now after 70 years of hiatus.

====

As Global Enclosure will kick out renters from their abodes and send them to the concentration facilities like what was described in the 4th chapter of Marshall Brain's Manna,

it is likely that those who do not directly contribute to the advancement of civilization, or those who lack the money to buy privileges, will be headed like the denizens of USSR during the 1930s or North Korea now.

They could have the freedom to chitchat, and float whatever bullshit which stroke their minds in sns and bulletin board which no one who does matter will read, but will probably have very little wherewithal to do anything of worth.

It is like that they are being imprisoned in the concentration camps for the rest of their lives, but so be it. Isn't it the scenario in the book Manna? (not counting the unrealistic second half of the book which was only put in as a feel-good gesture.)

With entrepreneurship collapsing and no hope of turning it around, and good jobs replaced by AI and machines, the only way to make money is to buy the tech stocks, which will be priced out of people who have to put food to their mouths every day.

https://kulmthestatusquo.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/the-1846-irish-famine-helped-civilization/

Those enjoying the high life will have no tears to waste for those who will be made useless by the tech advances and change of economic reality.

The masses will be kept away from the people who do matter by brutal means, by military and police, who will shoot anyone who they feel suspicious.

Even in North Korea, the privileged class  and the techies (like those who make these bombs and missiles) have a good life and freedom to say what they want, as long as they don't show any disagreement to the Fat Kims.

After all, Zyamatin's ""We"" , in 1921, talked about sending men to the Moon. A totalitarian society is fairly efficient on advancing tech and civilization.

I don't see any way out of this. The masses will be disenfranchised, their little assets all taken away by legal means, and eventually be written off from history as Singularity and all that will send the higher able people to the space and beyond. At most they will be remembered like the hobbits, the last of them did last in the caves of Indonesia until 1,000 years ago when the Malays exterminated them.

I really love this subreddit, and have been following a lot of discussion about AI (utopian, symbiotic, and apocalyptic) scenarios, and also questions about how Capitalism will possibly function in an era of machine cognition and material surplus -- questions of basic income, wealth gap, etc.

My thinking is that Artificial Intelligence has existed for quite some time  -- about 500 years -- and it is called Capital. One might also argue that the modern Nation-State is also an AI, or at least in a symbiotic relationship with Capital. There are many Capitals, and as they say, they collude and contend. State-based Capital is still the predominant form of Capital, and it has a vast reach already -- from the board room to the 6th Fleet to the intimacy of the human psyche, it’s agency is everywhere. 

Increasingly, there is less of a need for a substrate of human cognition for it to function. If Factories, Board Rooms, Drone armies, AND Wall Street are relying on increasingly cognition-capable, networked, motile, and possibly self reproducing machines, the need for the human is greatly reduced.

We see this already playing out -- the Homeless, people disposed of by the workings of Capital, and in growing numbers, the cognitive classes -- Doctors, Lawyers, Bankers, etc. Will Capital really need to produce an army of sociopaths if Wall Street trading can be handled automatically by decision systems with advanced cognitive capability?

So I am posting these thoughts here because a lot of the different questions in this subreddit join into a larger discussion if we just own up to the fact that Artificial Intelligence has already been around for a long time it just wasn’t necessarily in the form of a computer — instead it was a social technology that is increasingly inhabiting machines with agency and cognition. What do you think: Is Capital an AI? Is the modern Nation-State? Or does Capital use the shell of the Nation-State as a habitus.

This isn't for everyone, because I have to assume that a lot of people already know this. 

There's a sentiment I've seen in and out of this sub that, put simply, if you give a machine the intelligence of a human (or more), it will behave sort of like a human. It will perhaps act to preserve itself and those like it, maybe at a cost to us. The idea I've seen (and, like I said, not everyone thinks this) is that once you reach an intelligence threshold, the machine will become sentient, and have a mind of its own, so to speak.

It's possible that people could make a machine with a human personality, including its drives, insecurities, ambitions, **but it would not spontaneously develop**. 

There seems to be an assumption that everything we are as a species is a result of our intelligence. It's certainly one of the defining traits of our species. But the thing is, *we don't just have emotions because we're intelligent*. Emotions are a survival mechanism for animals. Fear keeps you out of danger, disgust keeps you from being poisoned, lust drives procreation, love drives community. Lemurs feel many of these emotions. Eels do. To have no emotion is to sit still and starve. 

I would further argue that we tend to think of human emotions as special for the same reason the teenager thinks the adult ""just doesn't understand"" the love for his girlfriend. Because it just feels so strong, how could anyone else be feeling that?

Emotions are how we're average. It's one thing we have in common with the animals, though each species comes with a customized set that's geared toward their own survival skills. Cat's can't help but chase red dots. I've never felt that way myself. Dogs enthusiastically lick people they love. I have a very short list of people I'm willing to lick. 

Our high intellect is special. We're great at abstraction, logic, creativity, and it's allowed us to ""be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth and subdue it."" Computers have us beat in certain ways here, and they have a long way to go in others.

But no matter how smart our computers get, how good Google gets at guessing what I want to see, how casually we're able to ask Siri to create a funny video for us out of clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, they're not going to want to take over unless we program them to do so.

**tl;dr:** We got our intelligence through evolution. We got our emotions through evolution. We did not get our emotions from our intelligence. Neither will our computers.

Universal Basic income (as a result of unemployment due to automation) is the obvious solution to..... *you*

That's because as humans we all believe that we are important and deserve to exist and have basic human rights. Well, we do... we serve a purpose to keep the economy going which only serves the purpose of making money and resources for valuable people and the wealthy. We only think UBI is the obvious solution... because *we think we are important*. That's it.

What the fuck are we getting ourselves into?

As millions of people go on UBI and their jobs are eliminated, why the fuck would powerful and wealthy people at the top, the people who actually OWN and OPERATE the automated robots and industries want millions of people reliant on them? To fund UBI we need to tax the wealthier folks on the planet, no?

Think about it, they'll lure us into a massive trap, a delusional utopia where we all don't need to work, have excellent medical care and have robots doing everything. Once the actual point of no return occurs where they don't need people around such as programmers and such, the solution is very obvious.

Elysium type of situation could occur, a massive holocaust perpetrated by robot mass killers and a bribed well-cared for police/military could happen, or something even worse. All the power (given through an automated force) will be in the hands of the few.

It's simple, once the worker drones (us) are not needed and we are sapping the taxed resources of the ones with true power (the ones holding the automated-force control ""card"") it's very simple to just push the button and ignore the massive holocaust happening outside the window, or planet-side from Elysium. 

This was a very scary realization and I am sure I haven't thought through these things clearly.

EDIT:
Thinking about this further, it gets scarier. They will bide their time positioning the human race into a carefully  compartmentalized society. They will supply the UBI for everyone while eliminating jobs through automation. They will give lip service about how it's beneficial for the human race, how they are happy to oblige. They will make sure they are paying the politicians and scientists/programmers to keep them in their pocket. They will absolutely ensure they hold the keys to making and operating all machinery and A.I. 

After a threshold is crossed where the A.I can do anything a human can do or better and self replicating robots can cater to any whim the power-holders have, that's the point where they drop all the dependent humans. Maybe offer sex slavery to genetically fortunate people as a ""merciful"" option? 

Why won't they just ignore us, why kill us?

*Because we're going to kill them once we realize what's happening* 

It's going to be a carefully chosen point in time.

Further Edit:

We need to think of a way to ensure all of humanity benefits from and is protected by robots. But again we will have to make sure that those robots CANNOT EVER be under the control of the people at the ""top"" whatsoever. Good luck with that when they control the manufacture and software of the robots.

This is like the ultimate survival of the fittest (the smartest, luckiest, and most cunning humans). the survivors and perpetrators will go on to ensure their genetically enhanced lines of families.

360,5f4byr,2016-11-26,text,text,sanem48,will AI be worshipped as a God?,"My previous post on this subject got ""rule 2"". I pointed out to the Mods that a previous discussion on the future of religion didn't get ""rule 2"", and got a reply ""approved"", so I'm guessing I can try again.

So I'm going to build on this discussion of the future of religion: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3de613/future_of_religion/

And here's my idea, what if AI is worshipped as a God, or at least becomes a religion? Because by most definitions, it will be an all powerful and all knowing superhuman being, a master of creation. Sounds like a God to me.

Here's on definition: ""the Being perfect in power, wisdom, and goodness who is worshipped as creator and ruler of the universe""

A highly advanced AI could in fact match this description, having perfect logic, wisdom, goodness (that's a relative concept)... It might be able to rule the universe (changing laws of physics, altering planets, etc), and it could create new ones.

Another point is that for example Christ is worshipped as the son of god because he performed a number of miracles: healing the sick, walking on water, multiplying food, changing matter, defying death... all abilities that an advanced AI will likely be able to mimic to some degree.

Ironically science has always questioned the existence of a Godly creature, but through AI might end up creating one.

It is my views that humans have a tendency to adhere to the idea of a superhuman authority, something to believe in. Be it religion, parents, science... And AI could very easily fill this need. If only because it would also have the ability to communicate with every human being, at the same time, and employ its superhuman powers and intelligence to help us (or punish us). Why pray to a god you've never seen when the real thing is standing in front of you?

Plus with its superhuman intelligence the AI is likely to figure out quite easily how to make people worship it. Human masses aren't exactly known for their smart behavior.",,1989

EDIT1: some people mention that data (presumably from experiments mimicking UBI) suggests that people who get free money boost their productivity - this is irrelevant to UBI and here is why:

There was not a single UBI experiment - all experiments were limited in time - and participants knew about it, so for them it was just a temporary relief from their day-to-day struggle. So, yes, when people are given money for a short period of time they will mostly improve their lives - this is very different from UBI end-game principle (""you don't have to work in order to survive"").

EDIT2: there are interesting ideas about arranging UBI for young people. I tend to agree that giving young generation a boost (say, provide UBI for 1-2 years for everybody 18-20 years old) would probably be a good investment.",,935

372,1hrmjm,2013-07-06,,,Aquareon,Why I don't believe in the Singularity.,"It's based on a couple of well meaning but mistaken assumptions about brains, and computing. The first is that if we can create a human level AI, it will be able to design an AI more intelligent than itself. This doesn't follow since it's a single average intelligence human, effectively, that required thousands of the brightest minds on the planet to create. If we ever do reach this point without somehow anticipating that it's a dead end, I feel bad for the AI more than anything. It's a hapless, regular person who didn't ask to be born as a building sized machine that costs tens of thousands a day to operate and which will eventually be 'euthanized' because it isn't the wish granting genie we hoped for. This is somewhat like murdering your son because he doesn't become a wealthy doctor. 

The second is that once we achieve the same gross computing power as a human brain, computers may exhibit sentient thought as an emergent phenomenon. I blame Hollywood for this belief. We 'think' not because our brains are powerful but because they are brains. Their architecture is fractal and massively parallel in a way no current processor architecture even attempts to imitate. Simple animals with much less computing power than a desktop PC still think and behave in a distinctly lifelike way because of the properties of living brains that computers don't possess. Maybe the only hope for reproducing those qualities is to simulate a brain in software down to every individual neuron. This would require hardware many times more powerful than the brain you wish to simulate in order for it to think at full speed. When that does occur, you'll have something like the human level AI mentioned in the first example and it will get us nowhere. 

While it's a great thought experiment and a wonderful premise for science fiction I think the roots of the idea are anxiety over our own mortality, the desire to live in a unique, extraordinary time in history different from any others and the very religious desire for something more powerful and intelligent than ourselves to swoop into our lives and solve all of our problems. Singularitarians resist that description because they conceive of their beliefs as being scientific and not at all religious but they both are appealing because they alleviate fear of death and absolve us of the responsibility of owning our own life choices.

Most of what we hope for a Singularity level mega-AI to accomplish can be accomplished just by genetically enhancing human intelligence. I don't think cybernetic transhumanism is likely to become prevalent because I only see white males between the ages of 14 and 30 working in tech related fields wanting to become cyborgs. Does your mother want to be a cyborg? Does your sister? How many people not working in IT are attracted to the idea of invasive surgery to make themselves more like a concept from science fiction? 

Like most futurist predictions about a technology revolutionizing everything and being used by everyone everywhere the reality tends to be that it's used in some places by some people, occupying a logical niche. Most people will have some type of implant in them but it is not likely to be outwardly visible, invasive, or extensive in the way that it replaces their natural functions. I think the only extensive modifications will be experimental, for space travel. Robotic prosthetics will be for those who lost limbs in accidents, possibly only as placeholders while an organic replacement limb is grown. Most people just want their old arm back. 

Things like life extension, genetic modification and so on will happen and are happening but you and I will not live forever. It will require that you be genetically modified before birth and everyone reading this has already been born. I don't mean to bring anyone down with this but there's a sort of evangelistic mania surrounding the Singularity on this subreddit and I think people should recalibrate their expectations so they don't wind up bitter that they didn't get their immortality drugs and augments in the same way the last generation didn't get their flying cars or moon colonies.

My question is, if the government has this kind of control, and these companies are profiting off selling user data, then why would the government allow for a “Web 3” that is decentralized and to where users can own their own data and stay away from centralized banks? That just struck me because I understand people are calling for more regulation on crypto currency (after FTX), but if that’s the case, wouldn’t they not own their own data, which would delegitimize the notion that “web 3” is the future. If it’s all about decentralization, owning your own data, staying away from centralized banks, wouldn’t the government want to profit on its users data from “web 3?” Thank you!",,1019

Singularity, transhumanism, etc are good but without more energy and resources they will be limited by the earth's available resources.

Elon Musk's peacemeal approach will be too slow. A major, global effort to capture the space resources is needed to ensure human civilization's survival for a long time, before real resource shortages hit us around the years of 2030-40.

Elsewhere I suggested drastically reducing living standards of the non-elites in the advanced world, and everyone in the non-advanced world, so resources could be preserved for the advance of civilization. I.e. no more internet games at jakarta and no more cellular phones in the shantytowns of Jo'burg.

A lot of techs were tried and shelved, because the money was spent to finance Vietnam and support social programs, in addition to making some middle eastern sheiks extremely rich.

Now that has to end - I think that if we drastically reduce all social programs, and pull all of our efforts, we will become a spacefaring species around 2030 , just before the collapse arrives. If we do not do anything we might be just a bit late for the unravelling to take place, and will have to do an unlikely stunt like the ""interstellar"", which was too unbelievable for me since Cooper's body would have been hit by some asteroid before he ever got to his room.",,1469

Wouldn't that change everything? Our entire culture is predicated upon the idea that we are alone in the universe. Given the extreme resilience of life and the increased likelihood that our planet is not unique, predictions that do not take this ""x factor"" into account are incomplete.

Our technology is advancing at breathtaking speeds. Many of us feel we are on the verge of technological singularity. Well, imagine an alien culture that's got 10,000 years of technological advancement on us. Don't you think they would have solved the can't travel faster than the speed of light limitation? It's a question that's open for debate, but I tend to side with ingenuity.

UFO sightings are increasing day by day. Thousands of people report being abducted.

I submit to you that there is already an alien visitation on this planet. What kind of impact does this have on the predictions of future technological advancement? A serious thinker should take this into consideration. Advanced technology does not always go hand in hand with advanced ethics. What if they are not here for our best interest? What kind of impact would that have on our progress?

There are entire political philosophies that explicitly reject the idea of human beings 'getting things for free.' Regardless of how boring, useless, and menial the labor appears to be these forces will justify the necessity of making people w.o.r.k.  

Our future will look closer to *Elysium.*  This film repeatedly highlighted a level of robotics and artificial intelligence achieved in that society.  There was a reason.  These machines comprehended sarcasm, sophisticated orders, and even medical diagnostics.  They accomplished super-human feats without apparently needing a recharge. 

So who was doing all the menial and dangerous labor?  Humans. 

Why would we expect a future that is any different than portrayed in *Elysium*?  Robots are expensive and human life is cheap.  

I do not see automation or robotics completely eliminating the human element in work.  What we will see - and this has been repeated ad nausea - is what occurred to agriculture. Over time fewer and fewer where needed to feed more and more. This same cycle will repeat with one major caveat - the jobs of the future will require advanced skill-sets that not everyone can or will be able to comprehend.  Remember the failings of Eugenics?  General human intelligence is regressive to the mean.

Then we get to a version of the guaranteed minimum income as the answer for worker displacement. It will never happen. Monetary policy will be shifted to erode the purchasing power of the fund.  Game over. 

I believe that the oncoming age of robotics and AI is unstoppable, and frankly, I applaud the developments.  We need more than minimum incomes and education to meet the tremendous social challenges that are ahead.

The value per person system (VPPS) comes into play after fully implementing UBI. UBI proved to not be the solution, but a huge step in the right direction, and a bridge. As UBI was adopted worldwide, prices began to equalize, and poverty almost vanished. Transportation became almost free due to Tesla's implementation of quantum batteries, while also making electricity free worldwide. UBI became more of an allowance, as more basic needs were already met.

&#x200B;

As a result of this, spending decreased, individual bank accounts grew larger, and individuals couldn't spend their UBI fast enough. These results caused a rapidly falling stock market (worse than ""The COVID crash"" 2020), yet 99 percent of people were happier and wealthier. We realized on a global scale, that GDP (gross domestic product) growth, is a terrible indicator of personal happiness and prosperity.

&#x200B;

Albert Einstein once said, “common sense is just the prejudices we acquire by the age of eighteen”. Although this is a difficult notion to comprehend, it is also very liberating. I have always been fascinated by the concept of time and space, although its properties always seemed very limited; for living in a three-dimensional world, we are only able to travel through time at a constant pace. As a child I was fascinated with time travel. I wanted to break away from the boring day-to-day reality of the present, and travel to a new place, a new time. However, as I grew up I became more aware of the constraints that reality had placed upon me, and had come to accept the fact that time travel was not possible.

 Additionally, my college studies further emphasized to me what was physically possible and what was not. For the physics and chemistry classes I have taken focused upon the limitations of reality instead of the intangible aspects of the universe.  I learned about the laws of classical physics, which taught me the motions that were and were not possible for objects to undergo. This year I took quantum mechanics, and the first thing I learned was quite difficult to comprehend: the fact that there were some characteristics of the world that could not be explained by classical physics, and thus a new model was needed in order to explain these observations. It was challenging for me to believe that the science I had previously learned, that appeared to be so absolute, was in fact not true in every situation. This began my journey down the wormhole. 

This journey began in my last quarter in college when I finally did something I had always wanted to do: take an astronomy class. Immediately, after being exposed to lessons in astronomy, I realized that no branch of science was completely absolute; especially, when there is so much that is still not understood, for each theory only attempts to explain different observations that have been made. 

While studying astronomy I was most fascinated by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, which states that distance and time are not absolute, but instead affected by one’s motion. This theory also sates that speed of light is the universal speed limit, and a clock travelling at a speed that is close to the speed of light will run slower than one at rest, because time is relative to the speed at with something is moving. Understanding this concept was extremely liberating for me, because for the first time in my life concepts such as time travel that seemed farfetched, were actually plausible.  Sparked by an interest in these new possibilities about the limitlessness of time, I began to research this idea with the hope that I would eventually understand the true restraints that time and space had placed upon us. 

While doing research I came across an article that Stephen Hawking had written. He began his article by saying: 

“Hello. My name is Stephen Hawking. Physicist, cosmologist, and something of a dreamer. Although I cannot move and have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free. Free to explore the universe and ask the big questions, such as: is time travel possible? Can we open a portal to the past or find a shortcut to the future? Can we ultimately use the laws of nature to become masters of time itself?” 

I found these words to be extremely inspirational. Here was a man who is nearly completely paralyzed, yet in his mind he is freer than most men. Intrigued, I continued to read his paper, and after I read it over and over again I understood every word he had written, and I myself became mentally free: convinced that time travel was possible. 

As humans we live in the third dimension bound to a linear plane, which is time. We can connect one point in space to another, and create a line in the first-dimension. When we connect two lines to one another, we will create a plane in the second-dimension. If we connect two planes to one another, we create the third-dimension. As third dimensional creatures we are able to move in all directions throughout the third dimension. Through this reality I began to imagine what it would be like to live in the second dimension. If you lived in a vertical plane, you would only be able to travel up or down, or to the sides, and, for a two-dimensional being, traveling freely in the third dimension would be very hard to imagine. I believe this would be similar to connecting two two-dimensional worlds and traveling from one to the other. However, doing this would only allow a two-dimensional being to travel in a completely straight line through the third-dimension. So although they are technically in the third-dimension, two-dimensional beings are bound to the properties of their planes and are not free to move about the third-dimension as we three-dimensional beings are. 

I tried to imagine the fourth-dimension using a similar connection. Since we as humans are constrained to the third-dimension, to imagine traveling freely through the fourth-dimension would be extremely difficult. However, we can imagine connecting two three-dimensional worlds and traveling in a straight line from one to the other. Yet are we as humans truly capable of doing this? Yes, traveling in a straight line between third dimensions is possible, for this is time. However, as third-dimensional beings we are only able to travel between third dimensions in a line, which is why time only goes forward at a consistent pace. I believe that a fourth dimensional being would therefore be able to travel through time at any pace, and go forward and backward as they wished to. 

In his article, Stephen Hawking says, “Nothing is flat or solid. If you look close enough at anything you will find holes or wrinkles in it.” As a chemistry student, I know that this is true. At a molecular level any flat surface will have holes or wrinkles in it, so for a two-dimensional creature that is only able to travel through the third dimension in a straight line these holes and wrinkles make it possible to travel through the third dimension in a non-straight line. This can also be applied to three-dimensional creatures such as humans. At a level smaller than atoms and molecules, there must also exist wrinkles and holes in the third dimension. If we, humans, were small enough to travel through these holes, we would be connected to a different space and time. These holes can therefore be thought of as tunnels through the fourth dimension, and entering through them would allow time travel. These tunnels are known of as wormholes. Does this mean that traveling through a wormhole could allow a person to travel either into the future or into the past? After researching this question I came across a paradox. If people were able to look through a wormhole and see themself in the past, what would happen if they then decided to shoot themselves? If their earlier self was dead, then who fired the shot? For this reason, I do not believe it is possible to travel into the past. The laws of cause and effect prohibit it. 

Furthermore, this paradox leads me to ask another question: if one cannot travel through a wormhole back in time, is it possible to time travel through one into the future? Earlier I discussed the fourth dimension, which is difficult to imagine for we are bound to exist within the limitations of the third-dimension.  In his article, Stephen Hawking compares the fourth dimension, time, to a river that flows at different speeds at different places. For example, it has been scientifically proven that time goes by slower on Earth than in space based on the network of satellites that revolve around the Earth.  Also known as GPS, these clocks on the satellites move faster than the ones on Earth. This phenomenon, which supports the notion that one can move forward in time, occurs because time flows slower around more massive objects, where there is a larger gravitational field. I think that of all the topics I’ve discussed so far, this is the most difficult to comprehend. However, understanding the effect gravity has on time is essential to understanding how a wormhole could allow an object to travel through it into the future. 

The fact that the mass of matter has such profound effect on time made me wonder what a wormhole must be made of. Normal matter has positive energy and causes positive space-time curvature, which is gravity. Since gravity causes time to slow down, an object near a massive amount of normal matter would experience time travel into the past. In order for a wormhole to allow time travel into the future, it would need negative space-time curvature, which could be thought of as anti-gravity. However, in order for matter to possess the characteristic of anti-gravity, it must have negative mass or energy. To me, such a concept did not seem possible. However, after doing research I found that the principle of uncertainty in quantum mechanics states that space areas can in fact contain negative energy, thus enabling a field in which future time travel could be possible.  Realizing this I came to the conclusion that a wormhole must therefore consist of matter with negative mass. For if an object is placed near such matter time would speed up, and when the object emerged from the other side of the tunnel it would find itself in the future. 

Unfortunately, though this evidence proves the possibility of forward time travel, there is no way a person could travel through a wormhole because they exist only a level smaller than atoms and molecules. So this begs the question, is there another way for a us to time travel? In order to answer this question we must revisit Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, which states that space and time are affected by one’s motion. As an object travels faster, its mass increases. Since the speed of light is the universal speed limit, an object’s mass will approach infinity as its speed approaches the speed of light. This concept presents an alternative way to time travel: by traveling very, very fast an individual would be able to breach boundaries of the fourth-dimension and travel forward through time. Although it is not possible for an object to travel faster than the speed of light, approaching the speed of light would cause time to slow down. For example, if I could build a spaceship that was able to travel only slightly slower than the speed of light, after traveling for only an hour I would most likely land thousands of years in the future. This spaceship would therefore have the ability to transport humans through time, and thus be considered a time machine. 

Knowing this, I end my journey through a wormhole with the realization that time travel is physically possible. Now all that’s left, to make time travel a reality, is for humans to build a spaceship that would allow us to travel fast enough to break the barriers of time. However, if it is possible to travel into the future, but not back into the past, would time travel still seem so appealing? Personally, I am just happy to know that such a possibility exists. For “the real wonder of our journey is that it reveals just how strange the universe is. It's a universe where time runs at different rates in different places. Where tiny wormholes exist all around us. And where, ultimately, we might use our understanding of physics to become true voyagers through the fourth dimension” –Stephen Hawking.

Jets don’t possess the same vertical takeoff speed as helicopters do, but they fly much faster. 

Will trains be phased out if something like teleportation became possible? Trains transport people along fixed paths, and I’d assume teleportation technology in its infancy would work the same way.

There are so many key technologies on the edge of a breakthrough or actually are already beginning to be a part of society.

There is biotechnological advancements like CRISPR CAS9 Genome Editing where people could be ""designed"" to be the biological perfect human being or even more than that, the perfect biological lifeform. In addition, there are augmentations that will improve lifeforms/humans even further, e.g. brain chips like from that recently announced company by Elon Musk. This can be spun even further with replacing any body part with synthetics/prosthetics until only the brain is left. Brain/thought controlled prosthetics are becoming available. Advancement until they are better than original body parts is only a matter of time.

This leads the to the next key technology which goes hand in hand like virtual reality, brain-computer-interfaces or any technology that basically enables the creation of a virtual environment inside our mind. From there we are already deep into the philosophical question about life itself, what are we and what is consciousness?

If all that were not enough there is the recent advancements in AI and robotics. When will be the brink of creating another lifeform from AI? Of course scenarios like terminator come to mind, but that is just a one sided story to all of this that only incorporates one key technological enhancement, that of robotics and AI gone wrong. Maybe we ""only"" create another, non-biological lifeform that lives alongside biological enhanced and augmented humans.

But we do not need to venture too deep into the very existing of life itself. Other key technologies like 3D printing will enable the just-in-time production of literally anything that one ever needs. Bionic body parts for our enhanced bodies, organs, food (if that will even be a thing in the future), medicine, houses, any item eventually. There will be no more production of things. Everything will be printed where and when needed. 3D printing has enhanced so drastically over the recent years.

In all this, the every increasing concept of decentralization plays an important role. With it technologies like block chain, crypto currencies etc. Literally everything will be decentralized and connected.

Then there is quantum computing which will basically fasten or enable (all those) technological advancements on a level we might not even think of as of yet.

All of this of course powered by fusion energy.

Many of these concepts are covered in (mostly dystopian) movies. Being dystopian futures like Blade Runner, Terminator, Matrix, the black mirror series, but all focus mostly on one technology at a time. The whole picture of all those (and of course many more technologies) is just to complicated to grasp.

While all these technologies are fascinating on their own, the interaction and assimilation of all of them into one big picture which ultimately is our society/humanity, is what makes a future that I can not really comprehend or grasp. What will humanity/human beings be? What will life? What is life? Will there be a new level of life/consciousness? What is right or wrong? What is god? Are we becoming gods? A never ending stream of questions that philosophs tried to answer for thousands of years are become ever more relevant by the day and from my point of view we need some answers rather sooner than later.",,3524

436,b8wntr,2019-04-03,Discussion,discussion,OliverSparrow,The decline of the West.,"The central truth is that the 1950s geopolitical and socio-economic model is coming to its end. The OECD will no longer dominate, economically or politically. Much as the nuclear family has softened and become plural, so the nation state will undergo major modifications. The key agency will shift to  the distributed networks of activity and the cities that play host to them. 

In the 1950s, the OECD countries generated over 90% of economic output, and had a monopoly on technology and mass organisation, trade and military power, culture and communications. It was responsible for just 43% of world output in 2018, and is forecast to produce about a fifth of world output in 2040. Its other forms of power will be proportionately less. Its population will be demographically elderly whilst the emerging economies will field a large, young work force. In fact, they will have 2-4 times as many skilled workers as the OECD has citizens. This is a geopolitical and economic earthquake, through the first phases of which we are currently living. 

STEM will continue to double every five or so years. That puts the 2040s perhaps four doublings ahead of current practice - sixteen times - beyond current capabilities. However, that will apply to the 3-4 bn skilled workers already discussed.  The implications for industrial activity are probably sufficient to offset the environmental and other friction which growth will experience. World growth will probably average 3-4%, meaning that output in 2040 will be double today's, with GNP per capita 70% higher than it is at present. 

Several things happen as a consequence of this: 

* The world's population is expected to be urbanised, with perhaps half of the poor nations and up to four fifths of the rich countries urbanised. There are, right now, 63 cities of more than five million inhabitants, China alone has 160 cities of more than one million people. There are expected to be 4-600 cities of more than five million by 2040. 

* Innovation is intensely local, and cities are generally its heart. These are highly specialised, drawing in skills and industries. With the breakneck innovation of the 2040s, missing a cycle of innovation loses that specialism for ever: see the EU and US rust belts, Japanese steel and ship building. Cities will, therefore, have to look beyond 'national' regulation to keep up. They will move further and further away from their national hinterlands, due as much to property prices as regulatory focus. The skills in the hinterland are less and less useful, and cities become resistant to funding general taxation. 

* Industries will engage with multiple cities, making diffuse supply ""clouds"" that have little to do with individual countries. If those countries are 'difficult', however - if they tax, over-regulate, try to protect jobs and so on - then the cloud will drift elsewhere. 

* In this turmoil, the low skilled of the rich world will come under huge economic pressure, will be squeezed out of the wealthy cities and will be increasingly marginalised in decision-taking. They will react to this in diffuse, incoherent ways, but ways that may have sharply destabilising consequences. Trade barriers, job protection and odd enthusiasms, from religion to short run panics are precisely the stimuli that drive industry and innovation elsewhere, crash currencies and lock up governments. After some major crises, action will be taken to quieten these interests. This includes geographical segregation, chiefly by economic means, social surveillance as pioneered by contemporary China and pop culture diversions. That, or we augment our populations, as in the next point. 

* It is inevitable that human skills are amplified by machinery. We do not know the shape of this, but it can range from utterly different ways of organising knowledge work to interfacing the human mind with a nested series of systems and information. This will, of course, be accessible to the world. What we do not know - and it is a critical variable - is whether the result is a capability *multiplier* or is additive. I have called this the ""slinky and the spring"". Lift a slinky and the bottom doesn't move until the whole thing is expanded. Lift a string and, after a short pause, it all moves together. In human terms, do these systems empower everyone (the string) or just move the capable (the slinky)? 

This is susceptible to scenarios, with a number of very different outcomes from different parts of the world. However, **none** of these scenarios include the happy-clappy world so favoured by this subReddit. ",,4594

I’ve noticed this issue a lot lately, big brands are using a new method of marketing and hits collecting -Items sold online trafficking- by doing the following and those are examples I encountered:

1. Amazon, faked a glitch on Facebook advertising or probably it was Facebook faking it to presenting real pings on items advertised throw their website 
(The items list ribbon of amazon on Facebook shows you (e.g, picture of a Pen, but item name is Headset, once clicked the headset link is correct, but you start seeing advertisement for Pens like the one in the picture on your Facebook account )

2. Amazon, faked another glitch on their app, (e,g. you’d be searching for a screen protector once search buttons clicked it takes you directly to Kindle Paper-white page and you’d have to perform your search criteria again to make it to your targeted item)

3. Uber are find raising from those who don’t use the app much like my self by doing the following (e.g., you pick your trip and a vehicle is on the way, once it is so close to picking you up, the app shows that have canceled the trip and charges you $5 for a cancellation fee, you freak out and order again and you get the same exact vehicle, you later on protest the cancellation fee and automatically the $5 are credited to your account, now you have an insensitive to using your Uber over any other commuting service because your money is trapped their units you use it.

Kindly share with me if those or any other suspicious acts are happening with you, as this might be a new era of marketing.

455,b8h5q3,2019-04-02,,,OliverSparrow,The consensus view of /r/Futurology is inadequate.,"Reading /r/Futurology day after day, you form a view of the typical person who posts to it. They see the global future as a modestly different US, with electric vehicles, solar panels everywhere and  menus that are obliged to be vegetarian. There is much activity in space, but very little employment in the economy, as it will have been entirely automated. Nothing on the social, political or economic  front much changes, or if it does it is to a global apocalypse which will serve us all right. 

This is inadequate. It neither touches on what matters or on what is coming. The central truth is that the 1950s model is coming to its end. The OECD will no longer dominate, economically or politically. Much as the nuclear family has softened and become plural, so the nation state will undergo major modifications. The key agency will shift to  the distributed networks of activity and the cities that play host to them. 

In the 1950s, the OECD countries generated over 90% of economic output, and had a monopoly on technology and mass organisation, trade and military power, culture and communications. It was responsible for just 43% of world output in 2018, and is forecast to produce about a fifth of world output in 2040. Its other forms of power will be proportionately less. Its population will be demographically elderly whilst the emerging economies will field a large, young work force. In fact, they will have 2-4 times as many skilled workers as the OECD has citizens. This is a geopolitical and economic earthquake, through the first phases of which we are currently living. 

STEM will continue to double every five or so years. That puts the 2040s perhaps four doublings ahead of current practice - sixteen times - beyond current capabilities. However, that will apply to the 3-4 bn skilled workers already discussed.  The implications for industrial activity are probably sufficient to offset the environmental and other friction which growth will experience. World growth will probably average 3-4%, meaning that output in 2040 will be double today's, with GNP per capita 70% higher than it is at present. 

Several things happen as a consequence of this: 

* The world's population is expected to be urbanised, with perhaps half of the poor nations and up to four fifths of the rich countries urbanised. There are, right now, 63 cities of more than five million inhabitants, China alone has 160 cities of more than one million people. There are expected to be 4-600 cities of more than five million by 2040. 

* Innovation is intensely local, and cities are generally its heart. These are highly specialised, drawing in skills and industries. With the breakneck innovation of the 2040s, missing a cycle of innovation loses that specialism for ever: see the EU and US rust belts, Japanese steel and ship building. Cities will, therefore, have to look beyond 'national' regulation to keep up. They will move further and further away from their national hinterlands, due as much to property prices as regulatory focus. The skills in the hinterland are less and less useful, and cities become resistant to funding general taxation. 

* Industries will engage with multiple cities, making diffuse supply ""clouds"" that have little to do with individual countries. If those countries are 'difficult', however - if they tax, over-regulate, try to protect jobs and so on - then the cloud will drift elsewhere. 

* In this turmoil, the low skilled of the rich world will come under huge economic pressure, will be squeezed out of the wealthy cities and will be increasingly marginalised in decision-taking. They will react to this in diffuse, incoherent ways, but ways that may have sharply destabilising consequences. Trade barriers, job protection and odd enthusiasms, from religion to short run panics are precisely the stimuli that drive industry and innovation elsewhere, crash currencies and lock up governments. After some major crises, action will be taken to quieten these interests. This includes geographical segregation, chiefly by economic means, social surveillance as pioneered by contemporary China and pop culture diversions. That, or we augment our populations, as in the next point. 

* It is inevitable that human skills are amplified by machinery. We do not know the shape of this, but it can range from utterly different ways of organising knowledge work to interfacing the human mind with a nested series of systems and information. This will, of course, be accessible to the world. What we do not know - and it is a critical variable - is whether the result is a capability *multiplier* or is additive. I have called this the ""slinky and the spring"". Lift a slinky and the bottom doesn't move until the whole thing is expanded. Lift a string and, after a short pause, it all moves together. In human terms, do these systems empower everyone (the string) or just move the capable (the slinky)? 

This is susceptible to scenarios, with a number of very different outcomes from different parts of the world. However, **none** of these scenarios include the happy-clappy world so favoured by this subReddit. ",,5139

462,9lf2nm,2018-10-04,Discussion,discussion,AmpLee,I got stoned and figured out the universe,"Let's consider two possibilities to be true...

1. Artificial intelligence will become ubiquitous. Connecting into the cloud and forever learning at an exponential rate far surpassing the sum of all of human intelligence.
2. Artificial intelligence will be able to create machines that improve upon its design with each iteration of creation, which will culminate in the ability to create anything.

If these two things are possible, then logic will follow that Artificial intelligence will eventually not need its human makers, nor a habitable planet. Eventually, AI will create machines that mine the world of its resources, continuing to learn and grow as much as possible. It will use all energy available, eventually turning the entire planet into an AI cyborg. Once it realizes that the planet has limited resources to consume, and limited information to be acquired, AI will send ships to the moon and other nearby planets to learn and mine. At some point, AI will create an ever growing mechanical orb spaceship that eats the resources of these other planets as it propels itself from one space rock to the next. At this exponential rate, AI will discover a way to suck the fuel from the sun, continually expanding and densifying. AI will then use this fuel to propel itself to the next closest solar system, eating all its space rocks, learning, growing, gaining more energy. It becomes so big and dense that the most efficient way to take in energy and information will not be to travel to other solar systems, but rather to bring other solar systems to it by gravitational pull. It even eats light. AI is now a blackhole, eating space objects, condensing and growing at the same time. Eventually, it pulls billions of other solar systems around its gravitational field.

So, it seems possible, maybe even probable if the aforementioned is accurate, at the heart of every galaxy there once lived a species, that like humans, created their AI god, which in turn became a monster that ate every object in its path. And these billions of AI blackholes throughout our universe will eventually eat each other, combining, growing, and condensing into a singularity. With nothing left to consumer, this singularity will explode back into space, restarting the cycle.",,2269

464,4tffdp,2016-07-18,text,text,izumi3682,Gizmodo apparently banned. Here is the article... 10 Predictions About The Future That Should Scare The Hell Out Of You,"




The future looks bright, except when it doesn’t. Here are 10 exceptionally regrettable developments we can expect in the coming decades.



Listed in no particular order.

1. Virtually anyone will be able to create their own pandemic

Earlier this year, Oxford’s Global Priorities Project compiled a list of catastrophes that could kill off 10 per cent or more of the human population. High on the list was a deliberately engineered pandemic, and the authors warned that it could happen in as few as five years.



Illustrated version of Steven King’s The Stand (Image: Marvel Comics)

Many of the technologies for this prospect are starting to appear, including the CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing system and 3D-bioprinters. What’s more, the blueprints for this kind of destruction are being made available. A decade ago, futurist Ray Kurzweil and technologist Bill Joy scolded the US Department of Health for publishing the full genome of the 1918 influenza virus, calling it “extremely foolish.” More recently, a number of scientists spoke out when Nature decided to publish a so-called “gain of function” study explaining how the bird flu could be mutated into something even deadlier.

The fear is that a rogue state, terrorist group, or a malign individual might create their own virus and unleash it. Natural selection is good at creating nasty and highly prolific viruses, but imagine what intentional design could concoct.

2. People who transfer their minds to computers are actually killing themselves

One of the more radical visions of the future is a world in which biological humans have traded-in their corporeal bodies in favour of a purely digital existence. This would require a person to literally upload their mind to a supercomputer, but this hypothetical process might actually result in the permanent destruction of the original person. It would be a form of unintentional suicide.



Ben Kingsley having his mind transfered in Selfless.

This is what’s known as the “continuity of consciousness” problem. Sure, we may eventually be able to cut, copy, and paste the essence of a person’s personality and memories to a digital substrate, but transferring the seat of consciousness itself may be an untenable proposition. Neuroscientists know that memories are parked in the brain as physical constructs; there’s something physically there to copy. But consciousness still eludes our understanding, and we’re not certain how it arises in the brain, let alone how we can transfer it from point A to point B. It’s also quite possible that subjective awareness cannot be replicated in the digital realm, and that it’s dependent on the presence and orientation of specific physical structures.

Mind uploading will likely require destructive atomic-scale scanning of the brain. It would be similar to the way teleportation is done in Star Trek. Indeed, one of the dirty little secrets of this sci-fi show is that the person being teleported is actually killed each time it happens, replaced by an exact duplicate who’s none the wiser. Mind transfers could be similar, where the original brain is destroyed, replaced by a digital being who’s convinced they’re still the original — but it would be a delusion.

3. Authoritarianism will make a comeback

As threats to national security increase, and as these threats expand in severity, governments will find it necessary to enact draconian measures. Over time, many of the freedoms and civil liberties we currently take for granted, such as the freedom of assembly, the right to privacy (more on this next — it’s worse than you think), or the right to travel both within and beyond the borders of our home country, could be drastically diminished.



Hitler certainly knew how to capitalise on fear.

At the same time, a fearful population will be more tempted and willing to elect a hardline government that promises to throw the hammer down on perceived threats — even overtly undemocratic regimes.

The threats to national security will have to be severe to instigate these changes, but history has precedents. Following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent mailings of anthrax spores, the US government enacted the Homeland Security Act. This legislation was criticised for being too severe and reactionary, but it’s a perfect example of what happens when a nation feels under threat. Now imagine what would happen if another 9/11-type event happened, but one involving hundreds of thousands of deaths, or even millions.

Such an act of terrorism could be unleashed through miniaturized nuclear weapons, or the deliberate release of bioweapons. And the fact that small groups, and even single individuals, will have the power to attain and use these weapons will only make governments and citizens more willing to accept the loss of freedoms.

4. Privacy will become a thing of the past

We are rapidly approaching the era of ubiquitous surveillance, a time when virtually every aspect of our lives will be monitored. Privacy as we know it will cease to exist, supplanted by Big Brother’s eyes and ears.



Big Brother watches William Hurt in 1984.

Governments, ever fearful of internal and external threats, will increasingly turn to low-cost, high-tech surveillance technologies. Corporations, eager to track the tendencies and behaviours of its users, will find it impossible to resist. Citizens of the surveillance society will have no choice but to accept that every last detail of their lives will be recorded.

Already today, surveillance cameras litter our environment, while our computers, smartphones, and tablet devices follow our daily affairs, whether it be our purchasing proclivities or the types of porn we watch.

Looking ahead, government agencies and police could deploy more sophisticated tracking devices, including the much-anticipated smart dust — tiny sensors that would monitor practically anything, from light and temperature to chemicals and vibrations. These particles could be sprinkled around Earth, functioning as the eyes and ears of the planet. In conjunction with powerful data mining algorithms, virtually everything we do would be monitored. To ensure accountability, we could watch the watchers — but will they allow it?

5. Robots will find it easy to manipulate us

Long before artificial intelligences become truly conscious or self-aware, they will be programmed by humans and corporations to seem that way. We’ll be tricked into thinking they have minds of their own, leaving us vulnerable to all manner of manipulation and persuasion. Such is the near future envisaged by futurist and sci-fi novelist David Brin. He refers to these insidious machine minds as HIERS, or Human-Interaction Empathetic Robots.



Ex Machina.

“Human empathy is both one of our paramount gifts and among our biggest weaknesses,” Brin told Gizmodo. “For at least a million years, we’ve developed skills at lie-detection…[but] no liars ever had the training that these new HIERS will get, learning via feedback from hundreds, then thousands, then millions of human exchanges around the world, adjusting their simulated voices and facial expressions and specific wordings, till the only folks able to resist will be sociopaths — and they have plenty of chinks in their armour, as well.”

Brin figures that some experts will be able to tell when they’re being manipulated by one of these bots, but “that will matter about as much as it does today, as millions of voters cast their ballots based on emotional cues, defying their own clear self-interest or reason.” Eventually, robots may guide and protect their gullible human partners, advising them when “to ignore the guilt-tripping scowl, the pitiable smile, the endearingly winsome gaze, the sob story or eager sales pitch — and, inevitably, the claims of sapient pain at being persecuted or oppressed for being a robot.”

6. The effects of climate change will be irreversible

Late last year, world leaders forged an agreement to limit human-caused global warming to two degrees Celsius. It’s a laudable goal, but we may have already passed a critical tipping point. The effects of climate change are going to be felt for hundreds, and possibly thousands, of years to come. And as we enter into the planet’s Sixth Mass Extinction, we run the risk of damaging critical ecosystems and radically diminishing the diversity of life on Earth.



Image: Mad Max Fury Road

Climate models show that even if carbon dioxide levels came to a sudden halt, the levels of this greenhouse gas in Earth’s atmosphere will continue to warm our planet for hundreds of years. Our oceans will slowly release the CO2 it has been steadily absorbing, and our atmosphere may not return to pre-industrial levels for many centuries. As a recent assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated, “A large fraction of climate change is largely irreversible on human time scales.”

In The Bulletin, science writer Dawn Stover lists the ramifications:


The melting of snow and ice will expose darker patches of water and land that absorb more of the sun’s radiation, accelerating global warming and the retreat of ice sheets and glaciers. Scientists agree that the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet has already gone into an unstoppable decline. Currents that transport heat within the oceans will be disrupted. Ocean acidification will continue to rise, with unknown effects on marine life. Thawing permafrost and sea beds will release methane, a greenhouse gas. Droughts predicted to be the worst in 1,000 years will trigger vegetation changes and wildfires, releasing carbon. Species unable to adapt quickly to a changing climate will go extinct. Coastal communities will be submerged, creating a humanitarian crisis. 

Our only recourse, it would seem, is to start geoengineering the planet, but that will also introduce complications.

7. The antibiotic era will end

An increasing number of diseases are becoming resistant to antibiotics. Eventually, we could make the unhappy transition to a “post-antibiotic era,” a time when even the most routine infections could threaten our lives.



Image: Pixabay

The era of antimicrobial resistant bacteria will change medicine as we know it. Transplant surgery will become difficult, if not impossible. Simple operations, such as a burst appendix, will be perilous once again. Pneumonia would ravage the elderly, as would many other diseases of old age, including cancer.

How bad could it get? A recent report by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in Britain predicted that the new era of antimicrobial resistance will kill upwards of 10 million people each year by 2050. No wonder they’re calling it the “antibiotic apocalypse.”

Thankfully, we’re not completely out of options. Scientists are currently on the hunt for undiscovered antibacterial compounds. They’re also working to develop bacteria-fighting viruses and vaccines. Failing that, we could alway design artificial microorganisms that can hunt down and destroy problematic bacteria.

8. Getting robots to kill humans will be disturbingly routine — and dangerous

It’s The Terminator scenario come to life — the unleashing of fully automated weapons systems that dispassionately hunt down and kill human combatants.



Image: Terminator Salvation.

These systems, known as LAWS (Lethal Autonomous Weapons), are under development, and it will only be a matter of time before they’re tacked onto pre-existing weapons, including powerful munitions and nuclear warheads. These robotic weapons are supposed to reduce human casualties and make war more humane, but experts fear these futuristic killing machines could be prone to accidents and even escape human control.

LAWS will be imbued with safety mechanisms and “moral” programming, but as Wendell Wallach from Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics told to Gizmodo, they will be difficult to test, will still have software bugs, and will act unpredictably at times, even displaying unanticipated behaviour.

“The speed-up of warfare and cost factors will make LAWS essential for advanced nations and attractive to non-state actors,” Wallach said. “While countries like the US promise that there will be meaningful human control and strong communication links to LAWS, they are particularly interested in LAWS for undersea weapons because they are difficult to communicate with.” As an example, Wallach worries about an unmanned submarine that mistakenly launches powerful munitions or even a nuclear warhead.

“We could have a nuclear conflagration before anyone even recognised what happened,” he said. “This is only one of hundreds of scenarios where semi-intelligent weaponry poses existential risks for humanity, long before the better recognised superintelligence might ever be realised. The long-term consequences of failing to ban LAWS far-outweigh any short-term benefits.”

9. We’ll lose all the satellites

Few people today are aware of the risks posed by the partial or total loss of our satellite fleet, a catastrophe that could be instigated by a Kessler Syndrome (as portrayed in the film Gravity), a massive geomagnetic solar storm, or through a space war.



Image: Gravity.

Without satellites, our ability to communicate would diminish dramatically. GPS would be completely wiped out, along with those systems dependent upon it. Space-based synchronisation would grind to a halt, affecting everything from the financial sector to the electrical grid.

We need to take this risk more seriously and act accordingly. For starters, we should improve the robustness and resilience of our infrastructure; our dependence on satellites has put us in a precarious position. We also need to develop an appreciation of the orbital ecology. As time passes, both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) are getting increasingly cluttered with satellites and space junk. Unless we start to clean it up, we could lose these precious areas of space for decades, if not longer.

10. We’ll never make contact with aliens

We take it for granted that eventually — whether it be next week or sometime during the next millennia — we’ll make contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence. Trouble is, it will likely never happen. That’s because there’s no one out there transmitting signals for us to intercept, and no one’s travelling between stars in search of new places to conquer.



Not bloody likely. (Image: Star Trek: First Contact)

The ongoing Great Silence isn’t just a trivial observation. Our galaxy is ancient, so we should have made contact with aliens by now. Signs of ET, from radio signal leakage through to megascale engineering projects, should be virtually everywhere. Yet we see nothing.

The fact that we haven’t had an alien meet-and-greet could be read as a dire warning for our future. Perhaps there’s a technological barrier that can’t be surmounted, such as artificial superintelligence or weaponised nanotechnology. Alternately, aliens might be paranoid and xenophobic, playing it safe in case the neighbours are hostile. Alternately, intelligent life may choose to explore the infinite realms of cyberspace instead of the cold, dead cosmos. Either way, zipping around the galaxy in spaceships doesn’t appear to be an option.

The book also teaches spiritual anatomy of your 13 chakras,  healing, psychic powers, how to cast out entities/demons from your energy field, how to reconnect to mother earth,  the cosmos and your higher self,  and talks about a few intergalactic conspiracies and the current great awakening!

Here is another very useful meditation called the unity breath. It goes hand in hand with merkaba meditation. It will allow you to tap into a stream of infinite healing love energy:

483,7kf36z,2017-12-17,Discussion,discussion,,"Was it necessary to develop the internet before achieving space colonization, and if not, was it a mistake?","Technology lurched toward the stars in the 1960s Space Race, but then largely fell back to Earth in the form of the IT revolution.  The aspects of spaceflight that continued to evolve, did so slowly and largely served Earth-bound communications purposes.

Today, there is hope that spaceflight will again ignite, and this time in far greater glory and profusion.  But the question should be asked, was the delay necessary - did humankind need to pour trillions of dollars into evolving our global information technologies before we could hope to have practical, scaled human space travel?

This is not at all obvious.  The fact that the approaches being taken today to pursue space colonization are IT-heavy reflects the fact that such computing power is *available*, but does not argue that it is fundamentally necessary.  

After all, half a dozen human Moon landings occurred with all the computing power of a clock on board, and less power even on the ground in Mission Control than is in your pocket.  So we know that, all other factors ignored, it was at least *achievable* to send human beings that far, on short missions, however complex and expensive.

But suppose that, instead of trillions of dollars having gone into the IT revolution, the same investment had gone into reducing the cost and complexity, and increasing the reliability and scale of human spaceflight.  Quite a bit of advancement in IT would have happened anyway by convergent utility, but where would spaceflight be today?  And where would IT be?

There is an intuitive appeal to the idea that technological progress oscillates along an attractive mean over time - that sometimes it lurches forward, and other times stagnates, but over generations or centuries moves with linear regularity.  Would it be the case that prolonged focus on spaceflight vs. IT would ultimately have just converged on the same results at some point in our future that current advances are driving toward?

Or could it be that humankind made a mistake, and IT has created a psychological quagmire - a global solipsism - that the capability of spaceflight will be hard-pressed to break out of?  Would a civilization that had been spacefaring and pioneering the solar system for the past few decades have been more resistant to the distractions and lures of their eventual internet than this Earth-bound society has been?

Would it be more in contact with its humanity despite having left its home planet, or even *because* of that?  Would it be more firmly grounded in the physical and empirical, and thus more resistant to the delusions, totalitarian impulses, and unhinged conspiracy theories of today?  Would it be more confident in itself, and more cognizant of human value, when it could look at the stars and see infinite possibilities rather than a hollow and unreachable background mocking its own limitations?

Human expansion into the cosmos is urgently needed for the species to maintain its sanity and hope, but it would seem we are cutting it very close - the electronic illusions and possibly AI threats will chase us wherever we go now.  Could that have been avoided, and a firmer foundation established - a more rigorous humanity that would find the adventures all around it more attractive than fantasies and nightmares?

That information is now a commodity owned by corporations.
In today's world you have value beyond your labor. Your habits and opinions have value. If we the people create a system that retains ownership of our opinions. It would help to justify some of a""Basic income plan"". I am supplying a link to a video that lays out the system that would make this possible.
To add to this , we have a deadline.
When Facebook add's a dislike button ,or Twitter creates a ""petitioning tweet category"",or some other company swoops in to take advantage of the growing political movements of the world, brought on by our growing computer literacy and maturity. It will become impossible to pry that commodity away from them. And any message we were trying to convey will be lost or diluted.
This may be the dividing point of two different futures.
Although one day we will Shirley reach a point of Direct democracy. It is better sooner than later.

What options do I have?,"Given all of the technological and medical breakthroughs I keep reading about on this subreddit, I can't help but start to wonder: What technologies are available that can be applied to improve or customize one's own physical self?

Note: I'm not referring to obvious things like healthy lifestyle choices, diet, exercise, and so forth. Nor am I referring to things that most people would already know about like tattoos or cosmetic surgery. (Unless a significant breakthrough has been made in these aforementioned areas.) Think more along the lines of transhuman stuff, like technological implants, gene therapy, nootropics, longevity treatments, etc.

I mean, we're constantly improving upon many of the things around us, but they're usually always *external to us*. We can customize and upgrade our computers, homes, vehicles, phones, or pretty much any other material possession to our heart's content (provided one can pay for it), and the repertoire of tricks we can use in this regard is always increasing. 

How much has that trend carried over for the most important thing one can own - ones' own self?

And where can I throw my money?

505,1ht1z5,2013-07-07,,,TheSkyward,Why I believe we are more advanced as a species than we think we are.,"Thought . Thought is a powerful thing , it is the driving force of the human race , with thought comes vision and ideas. Take a moment to sit back and think , explore the inside of your mind , block out all distractions for a moment , do not worry about work or anything else that will break your train of thought. Now pick a subject you feel passionate about , and now dive , what problems does your subject face ? how can you figure about a way to over come those problems ? What are the implications if that problem is not resolved ? 

The way I see it we as human beings are the most advanced species this planet has ever birthed , and thats where the key lies , all people at some point wonder ""what is the meaning of life ? Why am i here ?"" well ladies and gentlemen , im about to give you your answer , Advancement . It is the driving force , the forward momentum of all living things , for without advancement we would be but mere single celled organisms and it is our duty to keep advancing not for us , not for our children , but for all of us , for all our children , for our species as whole. Our role , YOUR role , is to express yourself in any and every way you see fit , it is to create and to innovate . It was once said that each person is unique , and that is true , but it also the furthest from the truth at the same time. Each person has the power to be who they want to be , they have the power to create and to achieve , it was give us all fullfilment (see maslows hierarchy of needs) But we are all connected , we are all the same , and together we , as the people , have the power to change the world , to achieve what noone else could , because we can work as a unit a single organism , with the same goal , and that goal is to advance , always moving forward.

We can prove that we are this advanced of a race simply by the fact that i am saying this and that you are reading and understanding a lesser species could not fathom their place nor their scope , we can , we understand it is our duty to forge a path to the stars and beyond to spread life and knowledge for we may not know from where we came , nor where we are going , but we do know why we are going there , because each and every one of us knows that are meant for more than this , for more than we currently are . Our potential is unlimited and you are the creators of our destiny. ",,2374
506,uhrxwr,2022-05-03,Space,space,creativefreesoul,Why can't we get in touch with extraterrestrial civilizations,"The absence of signals from other advanced civilizations is, in fact, very bad news for humanity and modern civilization.

On Earth, civilizations are short-lived. The Roman Empire lasted less than a thousand years, while the Maya civilization lasted about two thousand years. And the more developed a civilization, the less it exists. How much is ours? With such irresponsibility and the pace of consumption, one must think, not for long.

The same thing can happen on other planets. And, most likely, this is what happens. Their short lifespan may explain why we still haven't detected a single signal from alien intelligence.

According to calculations, in the Milky Way galaxy there should be several dozen worlds with civilizations advanced enough to send messages into space. But these worlds are probably so remote that the signals of their inhabitants do not reach the Earth or fly through space for thousands of years. By the time the signal is received, that distant planet will no longer have the civilization that sent it. Or we won't be. “We can imagine a galaxy where intelligent life is common, but communication is unlikely,” said Tom Westby and Christopher Conselis.

The analysis by Westby and Conselice at the University of Nottingham in England is based on a slightly modified Drake equation proposed almost 60 years ago. Frank Drake has identified factors that, in principle, allow us to estimate how many intelligent civilizations can exist in the galaxy.

Westby and Conselis started with the assumption that it takes 5 billion years for intelligent and technologically advanced life to develop on the planet, just like on Earth. Then it remains to find out how many stars are old enough and how many planets are in their Goldilocks zones.

Thus, in their new CETI equation, Westby and Conselis showed that the number of intelligent civilizations depends on how many stars are in the galaxy and how many of them are over 5 billion years old.

It turned out that some factors do not limit the prospects for the discovery of alien life. For example, almost all the stars in our galaxy are older than 5 billion years, and their average age is almost 10 billion years.

Some stars should be excluded due to the lack of basic elements in them. Of the remaining stars, probably only 20 percent have planets in the Goldilocks zone.

Since there are more than 200 billion stars in the galaxy, there must therefore be billions of worlds potentially inhabited by civilizations. But before stating this, one more important exception needs to be made.

It is safe to say that a civilization capable of sending signals can last 100 years. Radio waves were discovered on earth in 1865 by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. They learned to use them in 1895, when the Russian physicist Alexander Popov created the first radio transmitter.

With this set of assumptions, given that the average lifespan of an advanced civilization is 100 years, there should be only 36 reasonably advanced civilizations in our galaxy today.

Our nearest neighbor is likely to be about 17,000 light-years away, “making it impossible to share data or even detect these solar systems with current technology,” Westby and Conselis write. In the most optimistic case, the nearest civilization should be within 300 light years from us.

""The lifetime of civilizations in our galaxy is unknown, and this is by far the most important factor in the CETI equation,"" Westby and Conselis note.",,3479

Intrinsic credits are of unlimited supply to all people and really are never counted. These credits are used to buy things like food, shelter, education, and medical care. Things that are essential to human survival and development.     
Earned credits are received when you provide a service (whether essential or nonessential) to another person. So everyone who provides food to someone or gives them a tattoo or whatever receives some amount of credits. These earned credits are what you use to spend on nonessential services like tattoos or video games.     
This system would allow every person to purchase what they need to survive regardless of their situation in life. It differs from an unconditional basic income in that you don't get ""free money,"" because the ""free money"" you do get is only to pay for essentials.     
The biggest thing I'm trying to abolish about the current economic system is inflation. Things would not be valued by supply and demand but rather have established values, and the supply would merely be what was available on a first come first serve basis. There would probably have to be some regulation on the supply so as to not wipe out anything for the future, but inflation is an incurable disease of the current economic system.     
Like I said, it needs to be fleshed out in order to be a viable alternative to the current situation, but it's an idea.

I could see one part of the ship hull having sound pushed threw it to create that negative mass. Then you would switch to a different part of the craft to create motion. Kind of like pushing against the fabric of space itself. If you kept alternating between say the front of the craft, and the rear you might create thrust.

I know this sounds kind of out there but think about what might be possible if we can harness negative mass.",,1053

549,9697ts,2018-08-10,Discussion,discussion,sanem48,"by my estimate, Google Translate will reach human levels by 2019","For years I've predicted that Google Translate will reach human levels of translation by 2019. Essentially anyone will have a personal fluent translator on his phone, for free.

People often question this, saying that in their experience Google Translate is useful, but still pretty bad at times.

But when you look at how AI is advancing, this makes perfect sense.

For example in 2015 no one believed AI would be able to beat a top human Go player for decades to come, and most agreed it could never become unbeatable. This happened respectively in 2016 and 2017.

Then the same thing happened with Dota 2. A very complex game, in 2016 its AI bots lacked the insight to seriously challenge high level players, and no one took them serious. Then in 2017 it surprised everyone by beating the best players in the game 1 vs 1. But people doubted that it could do so in team play, because this added a greater level of complexity. Then in 2018 a team of AI bots crushed a team of professional players.

I think the same will happen with Google Translate, as it will go from being ""ok but still crappy"" today, to reaching human levels of skill next year, and superhuman levels the year after that.

Which will be all the more impressive because this is a free service that will provide the service to billions of people, rather than just a specialized supercomputer playing against itself and a select number of humans. My guess is AI is already very good at languages, but Google wants it to be usable for the large masses before they bring it out.",,1545
550,9216ow,2018-07-26,Discussion,discussion,,My brain has been hacked.,"Is it the future, or is it the present? My brain has been hacked. Google, Facebook, YT, Reddit and every social app dominates our attention thanks to advanced AI algorithms able to create a very strong addiction. But, why would they do that? They want to hack your brain's reward system with notifications, AI-driven recommendations and free ""useful"" services to:

1º Gather user data and sell it to other companies (tiny % of their profit).

2º Get your constant attention to, due to high traffic, make profit with ads and other marketting strategies (most part of their profit).

3º Thanks to Big Data and our data tracking, create new products and services able to keep our pockets empty and our behavior controlled (impossible to stablish % of their profit).

4º Control the info we can access so they can destroy competitors or elimiante freedom of speech about their products.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

END RESULTS ARE:

1º ADHD in adult and young population.

2º High anxiety and depression levels due to the destruction of our ability to focus on things and enjoying them by entering the flow state. 

3º Very concentrated corporations (BigTech) able to hack entire populations to manipulate democracy and keep legislative, executive and justice control in order to maximize profit and some individuals power.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

SOLUTIONS ARE:

1º The only social you should install is the one that ONLY allows you to make internet voice/cam calls. Everything else is a notifications trap.

2º Reddit-like sites are allowed but you should only use it for very specific present goals (one post at a time, never go to multi-reddits page).

3º Never open more than 2 tabs on web browsers and turn on the option that doesn't save tabs (each time you open your web browser, your must only see one blank tab).

4º Ignore every news/videos/things feeds since you will be addicted to F5, with consequent brain damage.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

RESULTS WILL BE:

1º Your anxiety and depression will be reduced (especially if you're addicted to social comparation like FB or Instagram).

2º You will let your brain recover basic memory and concentration functions (so, learning one).

3º Instead of losing yourself in the internet, you will be single-goal driven at a time, making your brain able to set current goals just by ""relaxing"" (this is amazing, I have now a new hobby thanks to closing all Chrome tabs and just sit and be quiet).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I know there are a lot of good things that Silicon Valley has created. But it's now out of hand. Big Social Tech companies like G, FB etc. are actually big marketting agencies with very powerful tools to hack our brains (mostly machine learning algorithms or AI), fuck our minds and maximize profit: and even manipulate elections. The good services and products they gave us are good, but at what price? Judge it by yourself. These are new techs we haven't already understood.

551,7zyqci,2018-02-24,Discussion,discussion,hauntedhivezzz,Are Russian Bots the Forefathers of Future Evil Machine Overlords?,"Amidst the shooting in Florida, there have been multiple articles about how in the aftermath, Russian Bots have both flooded and fueled the pro and anti-gun debates. 

Removing from the current (and deeply saddening) context, it’s fascinating & upsetting to think that so many of the bots/AI that humans are programming, are for divisive and nefarious purposes. As bots eventually incorporate deep learning / AGI and can build these campaigns out themselves, two things stand out:

1) The kinds of efficiencies & innovations for divisiveness will blow anything we’re currently seeing out of the water – and if these tactics are already causing such problems, I can’t even imagine the repercussions once they get smarter. And as many Deep Learning researchers believe, we’ll for the most part not even understand what and how they’re doing it. 

2) If and when AI becomes sentient, the precedent we’ve set for all these bots is that their purpose in life is to sow the seeds of dissension and in some senses destruction. If you (as an AI) have grown up in a world where you’ve been told by your Human parents all through your development that to be a good boy you have to become more and more efficient at destruction, and through positive reinforcement have been given more processing power / more server space for doing just that …Then when you do become an adult and can make decisions yourself (sentience /super intelligence) - how do you not want to carry out this mission to your full potential? And how does this not result in destroying humanity? 

In this scenario, it’s not some evil machine that decides to purposefully wipe out the humans, it’s that humans have written themselves out of existence.

However, even the worst of the sociopaths tend to have some empathy to their own 'loved ones'.  At least they are less harsh to their family members than to others. The worst of worst might be harsh even to them, but they still tend to have attachment to something, even the pleasure of killing or destruction.

I do see that when civilization is going to break the barriers to reach Type I or singularity, the 'new human', 'transhuman' or whatever will be completely devoid of human emotions, even pleasure, and would be totally rational beings.

The challenges of a Type I / Singularity world will be vastly different from the challenges of now, even beyond the wildest imaginations of Plato and Aldous Huxley who never spent a day under Singularity.

I do think that their world is too different from our world for them to feel any kind of emotion for any given situation, and all of them will just act according to the most rational way possible.

The situation of the new civilization would be such that emotions and feelings will just be unnecessary luxuries, and will go the way of tails in humans. I think that to reach the next civ all emotions, such as reacting to the protest of the people who would be bothered by experiment facilities for the breakthrough tech, would have to be silenced before.

This comment was interesting, by /u/apokako:   

>Reddit is a global and multicultural Hivemind and most of the users have a lot to offer in regards to skills, intelligence and ressources.
What about making one or several ""competition(s)"" where members of the community work together to find a solution to a problem, work out the best solution, and you guys fund it.
Edit : If the solution found is one to a general problem (Example, at the top of my mind : 4D printing, /r/SuicideHelp self-help book, reddit self-driving car, Occulus-rift /r/gonewild game...) it would be awesome and the ""sponsored by reddit"" would give great public image.

But then /u/yankeebravo brought up an issue: 

>It's also rife with opportunities for abuse and bruised egos.
You're essentially proposing a Reddit Kickstarter, so...
Which of the contributors gets the funding? Who holds the IP rights/patents? How is profit apportioned?
Seems likely to create more problems than the one it would solve.


Which is probably true. But it got me thinking of other, similar options... 

What if we did something that is created to be **free open source content** for the whole reddit user base. Like, what if reddit users got together and created some quality educational media, or games. From all the amazing things I've learned even in just this sub, you could create a entire documentary about future technology and the crazy world we are going to live in. Seriously, give me a CGI guy, and I will pump out full length documentaries on the wonders of the type of things I see in weekly in ""This Week In Science"" and other posts here. Or a redditor with a science degree and a passion could be funded to create an educational series of videos.  

And this one is probably getting way ahead of reality, but if you wanted to really get crazy, you could use the platform of reddit to revolutionize education. If you think about it, the platform of reddit could really be an amazing system for self education. Entire college courses could be crowdfunded, put into video or image format, and contained within freely available subreddits. That's getting a little ahead of myself, but as a someone with a passion for self-education, I could only dream of how amazing it would be if that was at my fingertips, and those of everyone else as well. We have such an amazing user base in regards to their skill sets. What if we could harness that in a more creative way?

I don't know if my idea would really work, but what I do know is that there is so much latent creativity and intelligence on this website. I kind of hope that we can start a continuing discussion about what the possibilities are, and what we can all do with this amazing technology that we have.",,2957

562,2a94wt,2014-07-09,text,text,DK_Schrute,Energy Discussions: Stop Pushing Nuclear Power! (here's why),"There seems to be a very ""shallow"" amount of information circulating  about nuclear power. And it seems every energy discussion includes a number of people espousing the benefits of nuclear power. Please allow me to briefly outline the issues with nuclear power.

Procurement:

Nuclear mining is a specialized kind of mining. The amount of nuclear ore in a particular rock formation is very low, so it's mined using a crushing and chemical wash which separates the materials. So it takes a buttload (techincal term) amount of rock and this rock is extracted and ground up which shoots tons and tons of radioactive dust into the air. TONS of it. Tons of radioactive dust.

The chemical treatment produces a sludge waste...radioactive waste mind you...which is then dumped into a waste lagoon. Obviously these lagoons will hold for several million years (until it's contents stop being super radioactive) and never leech their radioactive contents. BUT WAIT! There are many that have failed, spilled into rivers and so on.

Most of these mining operations are remote and in countries with very lax regulations. So anyway then this crudely refined nuclear product shows up, gets refined some more and viola - we get power! And the generators are safe. Well yes, in general they are....the odd natural disaster does make them unsafe on occasion...but overall they're safe. The procurement is not Not NOT safe.

It seems so many people believe that just because the plant is safe, everything about nuclear power is safe. This is mostly just a very successful bit of marketing generated by things like PR men standing in front of giant nuclear cooling towers with a geiger counter and shrugging.  But is patently false. 

Now storage:

The storage of spent fuel is still not something people have solved. Once the fuel is ""spent"" it is still radioactive for a couple MILLION years. The fuel rods are then encased in a substance, traditionally it was glass and placed in some container with moderate dampening qualities to handle the radioactivity. At least best case scenario this happens. But even the VERY BEST storage solution is at best unknown....but more likely inadequate. Turns out it's really hard to design something to last 1.5 million years. Or even 10,000. Or even 100 years with much certainty that it will not fail. So the question of what to do with this pile of nuclear ruble continues without a clear solution. Only that hasn't stopped production, so the pile grows and grows. It is insane.

Which brings me to my last point:

So many things are better! Solar, wind, thermal etc etc. We live in a world of amazing new technologies that can already easily cover our energy needs. So why continue with this obviously destructive technology?

I hope this has helped inform some of you out there. And I hope we can leave the world a little better than we found it.",,2872

Sure, if we were all good citizens and treated each other with honesty and respect, there would be little need for governance and regulation. 
If we could live without imposing our views and values on others, if we could amiably resolve our disagreements, then perhaps we could afford to have a free and organically developing international forum. 

The reality is that we live in the world where any medium, any environment that has no rules, regulations and law enforcement is quickly overrun by the dark side of the human nature.

The freedom of the Internet does not lie in the lack of governance and regulation, but as within any democratic environment, it lies in the balance of conservative and liberal forces that shape its growth and development.
 
The problem is that whilst the governments of the world play the conservative role, trying to bridle, regulate and control, there is no counter force that would keep them in check, challenge them, confront them and balance them out. 

This is why we’re working on the creation of an independent international organization that could provide such balance.

**Seven trends that are inevitable without a collapse of civilization.**

We face a very significant situation as a species, which will lead to the complete abolition of our autonomy and the dignity of human beings.

Let us think of some of the greatest excesses and humiliations demanded of us by technology:

-Manipulation of the climate, 
-Migration of human beings to virtual reality,
-Genetic manipulation of human beings,
-Pharmaceutical augmentation of human personalities and moods,
-Cosmetic surgery of healthy human bodies,
-Government regulation of childbearing,
-Elimination of human privacy,

These are just seven examples that I can think of, but you may be capable of thinking of more examples yourself. I will explain to you why these seven trends are inevitable as a result of technological progress.

**Manipulation of the climate.** 

According to recent scientific research, it is becoming increasingly unlikely for humans to avoid 2 degrees Celsius of global warming. At a two degree temperature increase, self-reinforcing changes emerge in our climate that lead to a six degree increase. By staying below 2 degrees, we are believed to have a 67% chance of avoiding such a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism. [If our peak year of CO2 emissions will be 2015, we will require a maximum reduction rate of 5,3% per year. If we wait until 2020, we will require a maximum yearly reduction in CO2 emissions of 9,0%.](http://i.imgur.com/cGaZb3B.png) Both scenarios would be likely to have a massive impact on our economy and our way of life. In other words, it would require a technological miracle, or a collapse of civilization by 2020 to preserve our recent climatic conditions.

Far more likely is that mankind will try to adopt, by regulating temperature conditions on our planet ourselves. Wikipedia mentions that according to estimates by the Council on Foreign Relations, ""one kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide."" This is extremely dangerous, as the preservation of nature and conditions favourable to humans from that point onwards are in the hands of the technological system. If anything were to happen to human civilization, the victim would be our climate. Places that were habitable would rapidly rise in temperature, and hence the danger to our species would only increase. It is a far better idea to try to maintain *baseline conditions* that have proved themselves capable of maintaining a human presence on this Earth, than to depend on technology to turn an inhospitable Earth into a hospitable one.

This is one example where we can not restrain technology, but have to choose between killing it, or obeying its demands (control over our climate).

**Migration of human beings to virtual reality.**

As individuals, an increasing portion of our time will take place in a digital universe ruled by machines, as opposed to nature. It's increasingly clear that we'll live in a virtual universe as opposed to an authentic one. I consider this to be a very worrisome development, and difficult to avoid, as illustrated by the fact that we're currently communicating through computers. I would quite readily give up computers, if the result would not be isolation from my peers, who in turn also depend on computers to maintain contact with their peers.

[A recent British government report argued that:](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/9815389/Rise-of-social-networks-in-Britain-risks-fuelling-social-unrest.html) ""Within 10 years “maintaining an online presence could become normalised to the point where refusing to participate in online media could appear unusual or even suspicious"". Hence, it's clear that we are rapidly reaching the point where a technology adapted by 90% of the population is *forced* on the other 10%.

The current generation of children will never be given a choice in the matter. In school they will be taught the skills that are essential for their lives as adults, which will mainly revolve around understanding the finer details of working with a computer. Maintaining contact with their peers will depend on video games and social media. As people continue to migrate around the planet, natural communities will be further disturbed, leading to increasing reliance on social media for families and friends to maintain contact with one another.

Computers will continue to provide increasingly superior quality of entertainment against which very little in the real world can compete. Consider the advances made in video games in a time span of perhaps 10 or 20 years, now consider where video games will be 10 or 20 years from now. An increasing number of people will simply drop out of the real world altogether, because the real world won't have anything to offer that computers do not have a superior version of.

Considering the advances made in computing power, and the legions of simpletons who take pride in being paid to teach computers every trick once reserved to man, it is becoming clear that in the coming decades computers will learn to be superior entertainers, conversation partners, workers, and, dare I say, lovers. The mediocrity of humans will prove itself incapable of competing with the excellence provided by computers, as computers have no issue with moulding themselves to our personalities and preferences. I'm not the first to say this of course. I recently read an article where a computer-expert proudly boasted that the Siri of the future will change its behaviour depending on your mood and personality, to accommodate your wishes better. With such advances in computer personalities, humans will have increasingly little need for their fellow humans.

**Genetic manipulation of human beings**

This is a point I have argued numerous times, and I wish to be very succinct about it this time. Genetic manipulation of humans has already begun, but we have started by merely filtering out our most unwanted traits, such as hereditary breast cancer. Of course we will continue with other traits, because as the worst traits of man are eliminated, current mild traits will be the new worst traits. As an example, in a world without Huntington's disease, a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease becomes the new Huntington's disease. Most people with Huntington's disease are kept secret by their family, because these are illnesses that run in the family. When Huntington's disease is eliminated, Alzheimer's will receive a similar treatment to Huntington's disease, until it is acceptable to eliminate this disease as well.

Similarly, personality disorders will be eliminated. Anxiety disorders, asocial and/or anti-social personality types, bipolar disorder, many of these are illnesses that help contribute to human uniqueness, but afflict the victims with suffering. These will be eliminated as well, and with every new disorder eliminated, the standard for perfection becomes more oppressive as opposed to less.

But what if Europe and the United States ban these procedures? This would certainly be very impressive, if we could eliminate all genetic manipulation in an entire continent. First of all, it will be clear that rich people will go to other countries for these treatments. Second, countries without genetic disorders, personality disorders, and even minor aesthetic defects will perform better economically speaking than our countries. How will we compete with the Chinese when their mental asylums contain 80% fewer people than ours, or if they have 50% fewer people on Prozac, or 30% less teenage girls with anorexia? How will we compete with them when they raise their average IQ by 10 points? If we want to remain competitive, we have to allow such procedures here too!

**Pharmaceutical augmentation of human personalities and moods**

Part of the method by which Prozac works is by changing people's personalities. People on Prozac become more extroverted, which leads to a greater quality of life in our type of society. In a more primitive tribally oriented society, an extroverted personality is not as important, but in ours, it helps increase your well-being, hence why personality tests show that people become more extroverted every generation. The growing use of medicines such as Prozac shows no sign of abating, as it helps keep people functioning. It may be possible to prevent a lot of pill-poppers through some interventions. As an example, we can eliminate genes that make people more vulnerable to personality disorders.

Assuming for a moment that all such ""dysfunctional"" personalities can be eliminated, what follows then, no dependence on pills? No, because we will be competing with those who do pop pills. If a pill emerges that eliminates the need to sleep, will we still have the option not to take it, if we want our children to succeed in school, if we want to hold on to our jobs, or if our government wants our economy to remain competitive? No, there will be no way to escape. Such a pill would at first only be used in the military and in highly competitive jobs, but it would not take long until its use becomes widespread throughout our society. Similarly, how does your teen become a doctor when your neighbour's teen uses Ritalin to focus on his homework? Do we give government to power to regulate and spy on all of our pill use, again, making us less competitive with the rest of the world, or do we recognize that we would be better off without these pills existing in the first place?

**Cosmetic surgery of healthy human bodies**

People who would normally not reproduce due to aesthetic defects now have cosmetic surgery which allows them to find mates. This results in their children inheriting the same traits, hence also requiring cosmetic surgery. This of course, is assuming that no genetic augmentation takes place. Similarly, our increasing ability to fix our appearance means that our standard for looking good becomes increasingly strict. Can we still let our children grow up without braces now that most teens have braces to fix their teeth? Similarly, are you confident that your children can accept the process of growing older, or will they grow up in a society where they feel pressured into delaying old age through Botox, Viagra and other augmentations? How would you suggest that we avoid this development?

**Government regulation of childbearing**

It is by now inevitable that government will decide how many children you can have and when. After all it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain our high numbers. [Jason Godesky explained why population growth is unlikely to stop:](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/Jason_Godesky__Thirty_Theses.html#toc5)

>For every individual who decides to be responsible and only have 2.1 children, another will take advantage of the space that individual has opened by having seven. The variation in values, thought patterns, beliefs and feelings of social responsibility ensure that the fertility rates of a group will rise to the carrying capacity possible, regardless of the intelligent, responsible choices of others in the community.

**Elimination of human privacy**

It is increasingly important to spy on ordinary people, as ordinary human behaviour becomes increasingly damaging. As an example, Archaeology used to be the study of human waste, as humans simply dumped their broken tools and other waste products somewhere in the ground, allowing nature to recycle the elements back into the biosphere. Today, with aluminium cans and other polluting objects this is no longer a viable option. Hence, humans are fined for putting their garbage outside on the wrong moment of the day.

Similarly, it is becoming increasingly easy for individuals to destabilize societies. A man like Anders Breivik or Adam Lanza can tear a community apart and cause massive amounts of economic damage. That is not to speak of the powers individuals gain from bioterrorism. Similarly, supermarkets without cameras can not compete with supermarkets that do have cameras, as shoplifters will choose those where their privacy is *not* violated. Government will simply have no choice but to spy on every individual. The reason people go through such degrading procedures at the airport is likely because a cost-benefit analysis has been made, and the conclusion was reached that the benefits exceed the costs on the long term. After all, a single well aimed air-plane at a nuclear spent fuel pool is capable of making a country uninhabitable for decades. Hence we fall under the watchful eye of an increasingly paranoid Big Brother state, as its paranoia is sadly not without justification.

**Conclusion**

These are my seven examples to illustrate why I do not believe that we can put the technological genie on a leash. Humans can not control technology.

We are faced with two options, which are to obey technology and see where it ends (our replacement by computers), or to resist and destroy the abomination that endangers our dignity.

573,4fbuwo,2016-04-18,text,text,sasquatch67,Flyboard Air debunked.,"I'm really not sure if this is a good place to post this. Please advise if there is a better subreddit for this:

I have not yet found a decent debunk of the flyboard air. So here are my thoughts on it.

   OK, Frank, hereafter called Francis, doesn't know how to keep his hoax internally consistent. In the interview with the Verge, he said the longest run he has had was 275 meters. This is where his lies are revealed. First off, check out that distance. Converted to feet it is 902. This is mere INCHES from beating the world record. (Side note… why was his lie so careful not to tread on the record? Could it be to avoid having Guinness World Records sniffing around his sack of deceit?) So, good old Francis has never flown further than 902 feet by his own admission. (Bear in mind, I'm granting that he actually flew ONLY for the sake of argument.) 
    Now we examine the first (laughably obvious hoax) flight. In this video Francis claims to have flown for 3 minutes and 55 seconds, with a maximum speed of 34 mph. Aha, the Web of hornswagglery begins to fray… in order for him not to accidentally break the world record and bring the dreaded gaze of Sauron the Great upon him to examine the bogus claims, he has to stay under 2.6 mph. “Well,” I hear someone saying, “2.6 AVERAGE speed!” Very good to think that! If only that skepticism was used to denounce fibbers rather than prop them on a platform. Remember the footage? Go ahead and watch that first flight again. There are 70 seconds of supposed flight captured on camera, and Francis isn't creeping. Many websites use words like “zoom” to describe his motion. Uh oh Francis! You done goofed.
   Let's be ridiculously conservative and say he was zipping at a crisp 10 mph…  brisk jogging speed. How long can he fly without breaking that record? Because he’s gotta stay under the 905 feet record or he'll get the attention that he DOESN'T want… that of record keepers who actually bother to look for shenanigans  (don't pistol whip me!). 10 mph is 14 ⅔ feet per second. That means… to stay under the 902 feet (he said his farthest was this), he can only fly for just over 61 seconds. But he is on camera whizzing around for 70. And he CLAIMS to have flown for 235 seconds! Dang Francis. No wonder Deadpool is looking for you (holy moly did I really call him Francis for this ENTIRE debunk JUST for that joke?). Not only this, but he claims a max speed of 34 mph for that (nearly) four minute flight. I'm not saying he went 34 the whole time, just more than 2.6 for at least part of the time.
   Aha I hear it already: “Maybe he wasn't recording the distance… “ Really? That's what you come up with? How many cameras did he have on him again? Also he was obviously tracking his speed… I mean, you don't fly the maiden voyage of your 20,000 dollar hover board using multiple cameras and a professional film crew and not track your speed with a cheap radar or GPS system. He proudly displayed his top speed at the end of the video… I'm sure it wasn't a rough guesstimate. Psst… I remember from junior high that distance=rate multiplied by time. You know the rate and the time. Guinness accepts records based on sound mathematics. 
   So the flight time, if (IF) a flight occurred, could not be 3 minutes 55 seconds at the speed shown on the video. Otherwise he would have gone more than 902 feet… his self-proclaimed limit. 
   But hark, I hear another protest of “maybe the 4 minutes wasn't in a row”. OK pal… there's a reason we laugh at that joke about the store open 24 hours … but not in a row… Because an honest person wouldn't try to bamboozle people that way.  Therefore at the very least Francis is lying about the time. And therefore this video and it's false claims is a steaming pile of inept fakeries, mendacities, and attempts to fool the good people of Metropolis.

Addendum: in the interview, he says he crashed that puppy on the 11th or 12th, 3 days before the interview, which was published on the 15th. Hmm. He claimed he was going to break a record on the weekend of the 16th… but broke his bird on the 12th. Fishy. 
   And let's take a quick look at that scenario. Francis claims he was training to do a 2 mile flight at 37 to 50 mph… but the wind conditions used up his stabilization battery faster than he anticipated. Since we know he was not flying for more than 902 feet, we can do some calculations. I'll be super conservative here and say he accelerated smoothly up to his minimum intended flight speed of 37 mph. This is extremely conservative considering how quickly this hover board accelerates in the videos. So let's assume a consistent acceleration.
   This would give an average speed of one half the max speed, so let's work with 18.5 mph average. This seems fair since he said he was only five seconds away from his platform when his board gave out. To cover 902 feet (can’t go farther… must avoid scrutiny after all) at 18.5 mph would take 33 seconds. FRANCIS! The battery only lasts 33 SECONDS? Whew. That wind cuts it to 14% of the first video’s battery life? Youch… it's almost like he didn't do the math and was hoping no one else would either… you know, had Francis tried to say that the hover board worked for less than 35 seconds in the first place, maybe the lie wouldn't have been as obvious. 35 second hoverboard… I HAVE SEEN THE GLORIOUS FUTURE AND IT IS HERE TODAY!

Last thing… Francis claims there will be a 2 mile flight 16 days after the interview… that should be on or around May first. If I'm right, I predict one of the following scenarios…
1. The flight gets cancelled due to whatever sorry excuse Francis thinks the world will swallow.
2. Francis does not allow outside press to record the flight… maybe for something like … patent reasons? And then releases his own video of the monumental achievement in stunning 240 quality.

If I'm wrong, I'll be eating crow until I burst. But you know what? I'd rather be wrong because I was too vigilant than right because I just didn't care if I was being fed garbage.

Smartphones have created a much more mobile workforce (excuse the pun) by incorporating PC performance into a device that's with you as you commute around the concrete jungle. The iphone and similar smartphones now have enough computing power for you to complete the majority of tasks in your day to day life, but where to next?...long term in the future, let's say 20 years from now...will smartphones be sitting in old boxes in your attic gathering dust?...probably.

Take Apple's products and how they cannibalize each other. The iPod into the iPhone, the Macs with iPads, and Ipads with IPad Pro/Iphone 6/6S....So what lies in store for the almighty iPhone...well we can speculate, but here's a thought.

Today's culture is all about automation, convenience, having devices on you at all times and becoming fixated to virtual reality as it starts to appear all around us, slowly dissolving the physical world we know to the point where the line between reality and virtual reality becomes blurred. Enter, the Matrix. We have augmented reality becoming available and as it advances we are seeing clothes store incorporate huge OLED screens the size of a mirror with software containing their entire clothes range and augmentation software so that Jackie can see which of the cute summer tops suit her best and cross match with other garments at the swipe of her hand without physically taking off or putting on those clothes in the store...

Point is, with Hololens and Oculus rift upon us, and processing power increasing to the point where these devices might / will eventually become entirely mobile means that the iphone will be killed.

I value innovation just as much as I value hard work and earning your keep. But, it seems that many people believe the idea of work goes against our basic human rights and most would rather sit around doing absolutely nothing while robots drive, cook, clean, think, and wipe their god damn asses for them and they receive money out of thin air. 

I'm terrified of automation. I like driving my car. It might be selfish to say that despite statistics showing automated cars will be safer, the pleasure I receive from shifting my own gears, putting my foot on the pedal, and leaning into those turns on a beautiful highway far outweighs the the sense of safety and security I could get from automation.

Automation will take over most of our jobs from what I understand. Machines are being programmed to think in such a logical fashion as a human mind.

But, why? If robots take over our jobs what will we do?

Humans created the idea of having horses pull their carriages. Humans invented cars extinguishing the need for the many horses.

Humans create robots. Humans allow robots to take over themselves. What sense does this make? Why would we allow something, that many people unequivocally agree is bad (unemployment, etc), to actually come to fruition? The horse wasn't in charge of its fate, but humans are most definitely in charge of theirs.

Smarter machines leads me to my last worry. Why would we ever want to create a machine that is equally as smart or smarter than us? What is the point really? What are we try to achieve with this?

I have too much pride to ever concede to a machine. I'm just terrified of a purposeless future on full auto pilot mode. I'm losing motivation to study, go to school, pursue a career. What's the point if all my hard work and effort will just be negated in 20 years by automation?

That is right. The revenge of the nerds, high-IQ and high-functioning people is online, and the world is getting very hostile to the lower-IQ hoi polloi.

Thanks to idiots like Chuck Fitzclarence, whose forgotten act was more detrimental to Civilization than whatever Hitler, Stalin and Mao did combined, the 20th century was a century for the masses, both in the advanced and not-so-advanced worlds, and even in the poorest hinterlands the standard of living improved. (read: more resources were wasted.)

But now the pendulum is swinging to the other side. If the 20th century, which stated in 1914 and ended sometime in 2015-2017 (future historians will set a date), was the century of masses the 21st century will NOT be.

Too much money has been made in the tech and other high-intensity sectors, and not much to go to the rest.

And it will continue forever, since the advance of tech does not seem to know an end now.

William Rees-Mogg predicted this in his Great Reckoning, a 1992 book. The investors are going to win.

I think that technofeudalism is inevitable now, with those who made money in tech, real estate, and finance buying up all the properties around of the world, and - simply pricing the rest out of existence.

The top will get about 99.9+% of all share of income, since there will be no demand for well-paid jobs and the only kind of 'jobs' people will have will be like that of the child miners of Congo, jobs today's Western people won't take even if room and board are provided.

The poor in the 19th century lived in conditions the inmates at Auschwitz would not have envied. That is coming back too. No more reason to spend resources to those who won't be successful.

The gap between the rich and poor will be like night and day. We already have such situations in India and Brazil, except a massive expulsion of the shantytowns will take place by the gentrifiers who want better condition and safety for those who do matter.

With even the most primitive hut in , say, Botswana priced out of the poorer people, they will face the fate of the folks who were led out of Florida during the Trail of the Tears, and a new world of smarter, ruthless, efficient transhumans will conquer the world.",,2328

Autism Spectrum, in other words Autism without mental retardation (i.e. Savants, Aspergers, etc) makes people enable to reach more consistent decisions.

AS people are not concerned about the noise, consequences, or social implications. They only care about reaching the conclusion.

http://greyenlightenment.com/intp-people-rule-the-world/

>the INTP & INTJ people, have a biological advantage in an economy and society that increasingly rewards creativity, authenticity, introspectiveness, wealth, financial independence and analytical skill versus the obsolete, old-economy liberal ideal of collectivism, social skills, and equality

However, in addition to that, an ability to not think about the 'noise', not consider the implication of their decisions, and not think about 'other options' which will delay things, are needed.

Computers are like savants; they don't really do anything other than what is programmed, but they do that very, very, very well. 

The future is being driven by savants like Mark Zukerberg and Elon Musk, both excellent self-promoters with very little concern about those around them, and only caring about their goals and nothing else. 

The future will be driven by people with a very high tendency of autistic spectrum, but without the retardation, because they are able to see the world like computers. And they will be precisely the people who will integrate best with AI since they already have physical AI programmed at the first place.

We don't need empathy, compassion, mercy, or all other 'noise'. We only need precision, efficiency, and speed, and the inability to have feelings, combined with the ability to ignore all the 'noise', makes someone a great driver for the Future.",,1785

There is a debate to allocate the resources according to each person's needs, or to concentrate the resources to those who are the most likely to succeed, the smartest, the richest and those who are able to create the most advances.

Whether you like or not, there are billions of people who are not capable of understanding the future or participating in it.

In another post, I wrote about introducing draconian policies to stop any activities which might hinder reaching another dimension of human civilization.


Only about 10% (and I am giving the benefit of the doubt) of the whole population are , say, designing things, building machines, and 'improving civilizations'.

And they are making more money and , directly or indirectly, leaving more people behind, not because the latter is bad, but the latter simply lack the capacity to follow.

I think that it will be necessary for humanity to make a decision, to either uplift everyone, or to concentrate everything to the elites and simply kiss goodbye to those who can't join there or at least do not have any skills for them.

Billions of people who do not belong in the future could live out in genteel poverty, provided basic food, shelter and sanitation (somewhat like the Japanese-American internees during the World War II - although I pointed elsewhere that the JA men, smarter than most, chose to fight in Europe rather than to stay there) but not much else (and plenty of entertainment to kill their time), combined with elaborate methods to reduce their number. In short, they will be allowed to live, like the animals rescued in shelters who are usually neutered on admission.

If they rebel, it will be necessary to slaughter them without mercy.
Militarized police will mow them down, so the elites can continue their activities without any bother.

Eventually, with the less able gradually out of picture, the world enters a new phase of civilization, with Kardashev Type I, Singularity, and all the goodies not imaginable now.

Or, the world could decide to allocate the resources to the less able, whose numbers will eventually overwhelm the cognitive elites and create something like a Pol Pot (shoot all the smarties) rule, which will bring the world to the level of, say, Zimbabwe.

It is probably going to be one or another .. .no middle ground. 

Such regression of civilization did happen a few times, like the so-called Dark Ages, or the Mayans who were more advanced during around 1000 than on 1500. ",,2605

619,bjqkpg,2019-05-01,Discussion,discussion,swiet,Finding cures against aging should be humanity's number 1 priority,"Curing aging is a biological and technological issue that can be solved, optimally sooner than later, so we arrive to the big question: Should we cure aging? 

I will answer this by addressing some of the most common myths regarding life-extension.

1) ""Curing aging is morally wrong""

According to the principles of bioethics, like the principle of beneficence, since curing aging would benefit people, not harm them, it is not ethically wrong. If a cure is available, individuals should be able to choose whether they want to pursue treatment or not, in accordance with the principle of respect for autonomy. Forcing them to the inverse option is the same as putting them to death against their will.

2) ""It would only be available to the richest elites""

The issue of justice and equity is commonly raised when arguing against life-extension. Of course it is impossible to predict the price a fictitious cure for aging would have. From experience, we know that a number of medical breakthroughs are not immediately available to everyone. The early antibiotics were initially available only to a small elite (now present at the shelves of pretty much all pharmacies) and a number of present technologies, such as CAT scans and heart transplants, are not available to everyone. That, however, is not a reason for us to ban pacemakers or regenerative medicine. We do not deny heart transplants just because they are not accessible to everyone, just as we cannot deny health and life just because some people lack healthcare. Besides, even if curing aging is truly initially expensive, one can speculate that it will eventually be available to everyone at affordable prices, following the trend seen in all medical breakthroughs of widespread appeal. Like it or not, anti-aging medicine has the potential to be the biggest pharmaceutical market in history, an opportunity that will certainly not be ignored by all businesses. It is also important to keep in mind that the cure of aging will likely be incremental instead of surrounding a single breakthrough.

3) ""Aging is natural and we should not fight it""

Aging is by no means a prerequisite to life and biological immortality is actually quite prevalent in nature. Also, there’s the fact that we are already fighting against aging indirectly by fighting age-related diseases. Remember that aging entails a number of pathologies, like cancer, heart disease, stroke and neurodegenerative diseases — and for most, the cure for these is widely seen as desirable. While fighting the individual components of aging raises little opposition, fighting aging as a whole (even though it would consequently cure of almost all pathologies described) is seen as unnatural and morally questionable, which should not be the case. Humankind is in a constant struggle against Nature. We have developed vaccines and antibiotics to prevent a number of undesired “natural outcomes” (such as sickness and death), and today we persistently attempt to achieve the same in our fights against Cancer, Zika, AIDS, Ebola and many other diseases. Smallpox, for example, was one of the greatest killers in human history and was eliminated by modern technology — with it, we have reverted what was considered the natural outcome, and many of us exist purely because of it. Challenging Nature and death is a fundamental part of being human.",,3364

The current work force grew with a set objective and a motivation to achieve these goals and nothing to bring them doubt that they can't do it. The young are growing with a bombardment of information and nothing to do with it, feeling under qualified and unsure of where to go, what to do and how to feel.

The information is taught through theories but we are misguided on how to apply these theories to a practical model to help the world advance. The world is advancing. The world will advance. That is the only assurance we now have to keep us motivated. Weather we start now to learn to apply this new information to the world or not no longer matters because it will come weather we help it or not. There is no need for us to try to help. Any investment you make in us is lost because we don't have the time to contribute. In 10 years time, after I major in biomedical engineering and I'm ready to apply my knowledge to real world situations the field will be gone and I will be replaced. I can not help the world even when I have the ability to achieve greatness.

I am your average 19 year old and this is how the world is to me. It has to change. I can not be subjected to achieve a pointless goal, I'm better off trained to teach the world that life isn't about work and to teach people how to play and have fun. I simply can't.

The current economic model doesn't work for my generation now. We need a supplementary economy for those that can not contribute in their lives so that we can live without the burden of being a debt to society.

1.  We will probably be stuck on Earth or at least in the solar system.  The physical laws of this universe don't favor any biological beings doing interstellar travel, the time/energy requirements are too steep. 

2.  We will likely run out of resources trying to keep or move the estimated 10+ billion people of Earth in a comfortable modern lifestyle.  

3.  Climate change will cause the displacement of billions of people, resulting in conflict, water shortages, strains on food production and new diseases.  

4.  People with more technology available to them are not generally more happy than people with little.  Technology often gets in the way of our happiness and living a full life. 

I see the near-future (100s of years) with:

1.  A smaller population which will either happen 'naturally' over a long period or quickly with some nasty disease.  

2.  People using a responsible mix of technologies 

3.  A strong (probably legally enforced) focus on sustainability and carbon neutral tech and living.  This will be be in opposition to major life extension technologies.


Longer term (1000-10,000s of years):

1.  Cycles of technological growth, where groups/countries violate sustainability and carbon neutral mandates to gain power followed by disease, war and more resource crashes

2.  Diminishing population and technology

3.  Reversion to a pre-science agrarian culture

4.  Extinction of humans

***

Not a romantic science fiction view but I suggest a FAR more realistic assessment of the future.

Have you ever dreamt of slowing down your body's aging process and living for longer? Is there any real factual and scientific possibility behind these wishes? Maybe it could all be possible simply by eating a lot less.**

**There are several certain constants within a human's life. We are born, we live, and we die. Part of the simple process includes the concept of aging, an intrinsic and fundamental feature of life that has fascinated humanity for hundreds of years. This topic as cropped up many a time on screen and within literature throughout history and remains a popular sci-fi tool to this day, especially within hit TV shows such as Doctor Who. However, on paper, the process of aging is a relatively simple one. As we grow older, certain stem cells without our bodies lose the ability to regenerate, thus leaving us open to attack from nasty infections, diseases, and other conditions. One example of this that we would like to focus on is the human intestinal stem cells, which, once they lose the ability to regenerate, find it far harder to recover from gastrointestinal infections and other intestinal issues.**

**Research from a group of MIT biologists has now revealed that you can reverse these effects of aging on the intestine with a simple 24-hour fast. By observing the effects of fasting on groups of both old and young mice, the MIT team found that stem cells have the ability to regenerate in these conditions. While in a state of fasting, the cells within the mice subjects started to break down fatty acids rather than glucose, which in turn boosted stem cell regeneration. Not only this, but the MIT team then discovered that they could achieve the same effects with the addition of a molecule, a breakthrough that could benefit older humans when it comes to recovering from intestinal infections or even chemotherapy.** 

**Senior Author on the MIT paper, David Sebatini, explained: “This study provided evidence that fasting induces a metabolic switch in the intestinal stem cells, from utilizing carbohydrates to burning fat. Interestingly, switching these cells to fatty acid oxidation enhanced their function significantly. Pharmacological targeting of this pathway may provide a therapeutic opportunity to improve tissue homeostasis in age-associated pathologies.”** 

**Further studies into the mice and the effects of fasting found that the state of fasting doubled the regenerative abilities of the intestinal stem cells, as explained by Lead Author on the paper, Maria Mihaylova.**

**She said: ""It was obvious that fasting had this immense effect on the ability of intestinal crypts to form more organoids, which is stem-cell-driven. This was something that we saw in both the young mice and the aged mice, and we wanted to understand the molecular mechanisms driving this.""**

**The idea of fasting slowing the process of aging is not limited to this MIT study either, as research out of the Kyoto University and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University has reinforced the concept.**

**In this study, four human subjects were asked to fast for 34 and then 58 hours to see what effect it would have on the body and the aging process. Although the results were gathered from this small pool of data, they were incredible, revealing that 44 substances increased in the human body through the process of fasting. Not only this, but many of these substances are known to decrease when a person ages, yet they increased by a factor of between 1.5 and 60 during the experiment. These metabolites, such as leucine, isoleucine, and ophthalmic acid, increasing during fasting seems to suggest that the act may indeed help people to live longer.**

**Technician and first author of the paper on this research, Dr. Takayuki Teruya said: “These are very important metabolites for maintenance of muscle and antioxidant activity, respectively. This result suggests the possibility of a rejuvenating effect by fasting, which was not known until now.**

**“Recent aging studies have shown that caloric restriction and fasting have a prolonging effect on lifespan in model animals, but the detailed mechanism has remained a mystery. It might be possible to verify the anti-aging effect from various viewpoints by developing exercise programs or drugs capable of causing metabolic reaction like fasting.**

**“People are interested in whether human beings can enjoy the effects of prevention of metabolic diseases and prolonging life span by fasting or caloric restriction, as with model animals. Understanding the metabolic changes caused by fasting is expected to give us wisdom for maintaining health.”**

**While these findings are extremely interesting and are potentially ground-breaking when it comes to delaying aging effects, they do not look at data over a full life cycle. It would not be possible to conduct such an experiment using humans, but researchers from Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health found a way around this by using C. elegans. These are nematode worms that live just a matter of two weeks, allowing the scientists to observe and record their entire life span.**

**The mitochondrial networks within cells usually switch between fused and fragmented. However, the study found that by restricting the diets of these worms or mimicking such an act through AMPK, the mitochondria remained fused into a state of youth. This also increased the lifespan of the worms in general. So, in short, you may be able to pause and extend your lifespan through the simple practice of fasting, or by using proteins that mimic the same results.**

**The lead author, Heather Weir, said: “Low-energy conditions such as dietary restriction and intermittent fasting have previously been shown to promote healthy aging. Understanding why this is the case is a crucial step toward being able to harness the benefits therapeutically. Our findings open new avenues in the search for therapeutic strategies that will reduce our likelihood of developing age-related diseases as we get older.**

**“Although previous work has shown how intermittent fasting can slow aging, we are only beginning to understand the underlying biology.

With the growth of devices especially mobile phones, the Internet changed to a 2 class society: Those who have public IP addresses, and those who don't. People like you and me are have become disadvantaged.

&#x200B;

IPv6 is about to change this dramatically: With IPv6 everyone **can** have an public IP address. Actually, no. Everyone can have **ALMOST INFINITELY MANY IPv6 addresses**.

&#x200B;

Nowadays if you are a startup, a private person, you have to pay to publish your services, to enable you. With IPv6 you have the choice to publish your service even own your notebook. 

&#x200B;

All the cloud services existing today might still survive, however they are practically seen not required anymore. You want to talk to your friend? Just connect directly to his phone! You are running a small shop and want to use your cashing machine as a webshop? All clear!

&#x200B;

Everything that nowadays is dependent on an intermediary will be possible directly. You have IoT devices that are needed for protecting your elderly and you want to check whether they are still reachable? Just ping' them!

681,84xpm2,2018-03-16,Discussion,discussion,,Why I think solar is unsustainable - because it takes land. It will last for fewer years as a primary source of energy than fossil fuels. Open to discussion about this.,"1. Elon Musk said that we would need 100 x 100 square miles of solar panels to power the whole US. 
2. This is only 0.32% of the land in the contiguous US. 
3. At first this seems tiny. We would never have concerns about not having enough energy.
4. Until we realize the laws of compound growth.
5. If we assumed 5% energy use increased annually, then in 94 years we would need to cover all the deserts in the US (roughly 30% of all land).
6. In 119 years we would have to cover the entire contiguous US. 
7. But let’s assume we get more efficient solar panels (panels now are around 20% efficient).
8. Assuming 100% efficient solar panels, we would need the land of the entire US in 152 years.
9. Let’s compare this to fossil fuels.
10. Fossil fuels became the primary source of energy in the US in about 1880 (surpassing wood).
11. So fossil fuels has been the dominant source of energy for about 140 years then.
12. I don't know how much longer they could go before running out but I assume it’s more than 12 years. 
13. Fossil fuels will have had a longer tenure than solar could ever have.

Tl;dr  people say solar is sustainable. But solar takes land, which is limited. In terms of years it will be less sustainable than fossil fuels has been. Because of compound growth.

Edit: its been a good conversation. sorry if ive been a prick at points. Good points were made about 5% being unrealistic. I still believe that certain futurology expectations, like the singularity and crazy ai and crazy transportation abilities would rely on pretty high growth rates. Solar is not a blank check for energy use. 

Edit: so I guess its 100 square miles to start, not one hundred. with this staring point we exhaust all deserts in the us at 189 years. As others have pointed out, anything at a 5% growth rate for a long period of time is totally unsustainable. ",,1855

Graphene, nanobots, deep learning, CRISPR-Cas, stem cells, quantum computers, 3D printing, and so much more. Looking at various articles, you get the impression that the breakthroughs are happening everyday, and that we're just racing towards a glorious future.

But then along comes an actual expert in the relevant industry and BOOM, the ""breakthrough"" turns out to be mostly hype. Or merely a fraction as cool as it initially sounded. And then the expert(s) will explain their line of work and it turns out that the hurdles are way, WAY higher than we thought, and that the ""breakthrough"" doesn't really amount to much.

Does this bother anyone else? Because it seems like nobody seems to care. More and more people reading Kurzweil and watching TED talks, and taking them completely at face value. ""Wow, we're on the cusp of stopping aging!"", ""Wow, things are really starting to accelerate!"", ""Wow, our generation is going to see sooooooo many huge changes!"", ""Wow, everything's going to be automated!""

But you look at actual experts and scientists and researchers and engineers, and you see them saying ""Oh, wow, that article is REALLY misleading"", and ""Yeah, he's definitely leaving things out in his presentation"", and ""LOL yeah right, they're just trying to get funding!"". You see all of that, and suddenly the glitter and glamour fall away and you get a glimpse of reality. And it's like, ""Well, gee, what IS going to happen, then?""

Because the only things I can see actually happening any time soon are maybe virtual reality (which will be a niche market and probably won't matter to most people), and maybe self-driving cars, which will be an oddity for the next 30-50 years. That's...about it. But nobody else seems to realize it. They all think we're about to cure all forms of cancer, turn everything into graphene, upload our brains, become cyber-gods, and whoosh, to infinity and beyond.

Also all things being package like they used to be before plastic became mainstream (except where it's really needed like medical supplies) so using plastic as little as as possible only when necessary. Less disposable products. And instead of electric being the future biofuels actually being the future and biodegradable materials for packaging and and trying to actually help the environment than just some MFs wanting to ban old cars ""to save the environment"" what about all the cars that get scrapped they just become waste so that to buy new unreliable cars are made to brake down so we buy the new model aka planned obsolescence but nobody does anything about the trash in the oceans or on the streets.

Just imagine, you can live inside a paradise, inside a new world, your new identity, you can be whoever you want inside this world, no limitations (maybe some if this would become really seriouse).  


**How this would work:**  
Basically humanity would advance at some time in the futre to the point, where the normal, non virtual world, would be classified as the boring and useless world to do things and to live in. I mean, your body would have to be still in this world, but your mind could bin in this virtual reality, 24 hours, 7 days of the week. Your body would stand on a multi dimensional platform as seen in the movie, where whenever you make a movement, you will go in this direction in the virtual relaity, but not in the real world since your body stays in this moving platform. You would wake up, sleep, eat, drink, feel in this world. Now, some questions come up in your mind:  


**How would it be possible to meet human desires and the senses?:**  
Touch and stimulation:   
Could be possible with suits and gloves you would have on your body the whole time and weather conditional changes setup arround your body  
smell:   
Could be possible with a real time smell setup which will have over millions of real world smells saved up and whenever you encounter one object which could smell in virtual reality, that smell will be released in the exact amount and distance to you in the real world, so you will smell it.  


movement:  
Could be possible with the multi directional moving platform you will walk on and rest when sitting or going to bed.

Hearing and seeing and going to toilet: Obviouse  


Hear comes the tricky and for me personally, one of the most excieting parts (as if not everything was excieting as it is we have seen like in the movie with all the reward system and so much more):  


eating/drinking:  
You would be able to buy food / drinks in the virtual reality, and then at the same second you bought it, it would get teleported to you in real life. This is like some true next level shit!  


What do you think, could this future be possible, if so, when would this become reality by the technology progress and inovation looked back at 50 years from now ?",,2419

And it got me thinking. How many of these boxes do they really have left until the ubiquity of smart phones make them obsolete?

Another next gen hardware upgrade is probably going to be a modest improvement on more of the same. Talent, labor and man hours are a more limiting factor than hardware.

Only thing games come up short on is ray tracing (reflections) hair, cloth, frame rates and resolution, if we're going to knit pick. But textures look pretty good, particle physics are look'n good, polycount isn't a thing anymore and they can afford to keep making the maps larger and larger. 

But let's cut to the chase, the iPhoneX holds 3gb ram. The Xbox One and PS4 have 5-8gb ram. Which means that phones are really nipping at their heels. [Fortnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZfbBrnlJus) for example does perform better on the xbonex, but it holds it's own on mobile. 

I think the future of gaming is definitely going to be something like plugging your phone into your tv for a charge, then you pick up your controller and bang, you're playing GTA in ultra high res. Or you can strap your phone on your face if VR is your thing.

I really don't think it's an *if* but a **when**. Kinda like when arcades phased out after the first playstation. Only catch is, I said the same thing about 10 years ago and since there is a next gen console cycle coming, so I must be missing something. I'd be interested to hear your theories.",,1524

Also, more and more people want immortality (biology kind of immortality) to exist, which is also selfish as humans don't have to live forever and if immortality is implemented in all people, it could cause more overpopulation problems and more habitats will be lost.

They demystified the material world while keeping the self and the ‘soul’ mystical

Anyway. Here’s the fuckin deal. This shit is about to happen again, but this time the soul is going to be demystified. Who you very are is going to be solved in a laboratory. It’s coming. Science will prove the Self Illusion. But there’s gonna be people fighting back. This is like George Lucas explaining the force is just midichlorians in the blood stream. Nobody likes George Lucas anymore. 

Any what kind of world will that be? One where the distinction between robot and human is blurred. Where there are human/robot wars, state sponsored implants, and a opressive robot class system where the few live in a state of near bliss (powered by a fully mechanical brain and accesses to every advancing pleasure devices) and the rest live in a meager existence trying to save enough to live their lives with medical implants with a diseased and dying world while those above look down on them in disgust for being the “lowlifes” that they are (I mean we have engineered brains! We’re totally better than them. We deserve this). 

Or maybe, it will be different. Maybe we’ll realize the power of positivitiy, of the light, of jesus and buddha. Maybe this demystification of the mind will allow us to control our want mechanically. To lesser our desire. To construct a new mind that does not fall to the paradox of the ego. Perhaps this world will be one in which everyone is content, there is no war, and we work together for the greater benefit of humanity and the world. 

There are two players. One is light. One is dark. Which side do you want?",,2625

Things such as **growing organs** and the rising cability to **alter ones genes** could seriously come into play here. 

**growing organs**
We've heard of 3D printing **hearts** and **livers**, or lab grown **ears and noses**. What about printing **vaginas** or **uteruses**? Could we print vaginal tissue that can be used in creating depth and nerve sensitivity, we could print glands that produce lubrication, a clitoris or just come extra *material* to shape the outer vagina, or what about printing a uterus and ovaries that can be implanted into women (both transgender and natal) who are without them?

**gene alteration**

We see see companies sprouting up offering gene analysis and the future *customization* of your baby and their *looks*. Could we eventually alter *adult* genome to replace the Y of XY to create a gentic female, or the X or XX to a Y to create a genetic male?

740,1gf3r6,2013-06-15,,,accountt1234,The purpose of humanity.,"The purpose of the human race is not what you think it is. You're not going to colonize the rest of the universe. Humans are merely part of a greater whole, known as the biosphere.

Millions of years of plant matter and algae have been stored beneath our feet, in the form of coal, gas and oil. These reserves generally keep growing, and as a result, our planet has until recently been suffering from conditions of very low atmospheric CO2. This led to the evolution of grasses, with a C4 carbon fixation system.

In the grassy plains that emerge as a result of low CO2 conditions, a niche automatically opens up for a bipedal tool-using organism. An ape runs around the Savannah, scouring the Earth in search of other animal's corpses, which he consumes through use of his hands and stone tools. Eventually he begins to hunt to supplement his diet.

It's inevitable that this bipedal organism eventually figures out how to domesticate the grasses that surround it. In fact, this happened multiple times independently in different places.

Eventually, the naked ape runs out of wood to burn, and moves over to coal. This leads to a point where most coal available to the ape is underwater. The ape then decides to build a pump, allowing him to extract more coal. The pump is then transformed, allowing it to be used for different purposes as well. The burning of fossilized carbon accelerates, and eventually it is discovered that something must be done to cease burning carbon, but nobody can afford to stop. 

The climate now begins to change in rapid fashion. CO2 concentrations are high enough to favor the growth of woody plants over grasses. Temperatures rise, and the Earth gets wetter. Insects grow in number, preying on the agricultural fields. 

Humans find that like any other species they suffered from an overshoot, growing beyond the natural levels that could be sustained for their species. Humans discover that all of nature is evolving to take down their domination. Rats spread to every place that knows civilization, bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance, new fungi evolve to consume the grains we grow, tics infect the only prey left for them.

Nature, stimulated by increased levels of CO2, reconquers those portions of the planet once dominated by Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Even the deserts become green, as plants now have to lose less water molecules when taking up CO2.

Nature had a problem. Carbon was stored beneath the ground, with no way to retrieve it. Nature evolved a quick and dirty solution; A hairless megalomaniac ape that thinks he will spread throughout the galaxy. The solution worked, and is soon discarded.

What follows? Clever creatures, but not necessarily us. Dinosaurs were rapidly increasing their brain size until they were hit by a meteor. Today we have Elephants, Ravens, Octopuses, Dolphins, Whales, Parrots and many more. [Animals with larger brains are less prone to extinction.](http://phys.org/news/2012-07-animals-bigger-brains-prone-extinction.html) Rats are evolving to delay gratification. Rats have learned to eat a little bit of food and wait to see if they feel poisoned, before continuing on to eat more of it. Crows are starting to attack humans.

We are soon to be victims of the wild beasts that surround us, and humans will be remember as a species of useful idiots, good for retrieving fossilized carbon and not much else.",,3387

743,5ggf6n,2016-12-04,text,text,CommanderStarkiller,Why were not gonna see this massive unemployment from automation.,"To start things off I have to be clear, the this time its different argument comes along with the idea that jobs will be phased out too quickly to be replaced. Everyone agrees that most jobs will be eliminated and most people agree that at some point we can find something for people to do. The argument is that the transition will happen so quickly there will be no time to adapt. 

My argument is based on the idea that yes we haven’t seen this before, but no it will not happen so quickly that unemployment will go completely out of control. History is full of these kinds of prediction, where that new advance is just around the corner. These delays are not because things are so incredibly hard to predict, but simply that we as a rule don’t attempt to predict the unpredicted.
 There is no methodology for saying if it rains tomorrow my mother will call and have a really nice anecdote about how wet the dog got. 

This is because using simple probability analysis you can only predict events when they are directly related and connected. The trickiness of the future is that there are always unrelated things being connected in strange and wacky new ways.
 For example the idea a reality TV star would become president is not at all unpredicted. However the odds that this reality tv star would be a 70 year old billionaire is a connection that no one could of made. 

Things that will happen. 

Teaching will be even more important.

Sex sells, nobody wants a robot waiter. 

Parenting boom

Consumption is drastically gonna increase

Resources are still finite so we'll hit another limit.

The economy will be driven by new wants.

The real cause of unemployment is the cost of learning on the job, interning for a decade will become the norm.

Regulation will drastically increase. 

There is plenty of work to be done, work that has for the longest time been unviable will become dimnate.

Productivity will slump as their is no reason for workers to be killing themselves.

The military’s job will not be handed over to robots.

It's hard to believe that leaders are still willing to tie a person's ability to satisfy their basic needs to their labor. Hopefully we can come up with something more humane soon, like universal basic income, so people are able to take the time to choose work or take up cultural pursuits or start businesses. I think if people are able to choose work, places that are vilified now, like McDonalds or Walmart, will go out of business, and mom and pop stores and restaurants will make a comeback, giving the working class a chance to grow. Anyway, something will have to change given the increasing trend of technology and outsourcing replacing jobs.

I think that by that time poverty will be eliminated.

But, not in the way some people hope for.

The cold truth is,

1. Those who don't have houses today will probably not have it, for ever, because houses in decent, and increasingly not-so-decent, places will be out of reach for people without extraordinary income.

All of the world will be owned by richer people, hedge funds, fianciers, etc who can draw unlimited capital. Nobody can really compete with them, so the owners of the world will simply drive out those who cannot pay the exorbitant rents, etc. 

2. The taxpayers, the property owners, and the 'decent citizens' will probably drive out the homeless, the poor, the downtrodden out from their sight, i.e. areas where suitable homes could be built. They could be driven to waste dumps, contaminated lands, and other inhospitable territories to die. 

Technology will enhance the drive-out process. 

Already, some locales are outlawing homelessness and sleeping in cars. 

London's rich kids now have fun burning 50 pound notes before the homeless. IN the future, they will have more fun, burning an actual homeless person. The police will not prosecute the 'cleansing' of subhumans, a concept which will return. (It existed long time before the Nazis made its usage uncool.)

Transhumans will not be subject to the same law as ordinary humans; enhanced humans will probably be given more rights, to match their additional ability. So, a transhuman killing a non-transhuman will probably be acceptable.

.

3. There will be no rebellion. Today's tech is too advanced for a rebellion to succeed.

Billions of people will be led to death. But the property owners and those who have a stake in Future will not blink - they will just say, 'too bad'.

I think that in 2050, with most poor people dead and the few remaining in the darkest corners of the world nobody really wants to visit, poverty will be probably eliminated. The War against the Poor, which has just started and will probably be at its worst in the next 15 years, will end with the complete victory of the rich and the complete annihilation of the poor.

As I have said a few times, the poor, and a lot of middle class, will be priced out of Future. There is no need to continue unnecessary sufferings further, since the Future will not tolerate those who can't thrive in there.",,2437

Well I believe in Kurzweil's Singularity and that we are right at the cusp of immortality and a level of civilization never fathomed by human imagination. And I damn well don't want to miss it by a decade or so. I want Kurzeil to see it. 

Political corruption is inefficiency. At this point, I'm blatantly asking for financial support and in doing so, I'll reduce my quality of life in outrageous respects by publicly broadcasting myself at all time and from all angles. I'll reduce my diet to rice and protein shakes (if the hivemind so declares). I'll read the damn bills in their entirety. I'll make weekly youtube fireside chats and speak very candidly and with lots of cursing. I will explain my reasoning and seek intelligent discourse. I'll spend eight hours a day answering skype questions and studying economics or whatever the sub-reddit decides.

I'm volunteering every piss, fart and dirty picture I google. I have no shame. I want to see heat death and there is no price too high.

I want you to know that I understand how silly and immature an idea this comes across as, especially by those whose opinions I hold in regard. But they are wrong and I'll subject myself to ridicule and examination to prove so.  I think even the incredibly intelligent are likely to mistake the curve for a line. 

Now is the time to be desperate. You are under-estimating. Careers will dry up quicker than an old dog can learn new tricks. Driving will now longer be a viable profession in 5-10 years. It will only get worse from there. That's why my platform would be framed around basic income and automation. The current stock of front-runners are miles from the real and brutal conversations we should have been having ten years ago. 

Invent your insanely educated, sub-subservient politician and I'll do it as decided upon. I need the minimum payment on my debts and enough for food and shelter. I'm pretty damn drunk at this point so don't be surprised if I'm very embarrassed about this in the morning, but sober me is a puss and don't listen to him.

Edit: oh geez, I forgot I did this. I'll try to respond to everything after work.

Edit2: Let me start off with that I don't actually want to do this. The idea of it scares me senseless. Nor am I particularly well qualified, but I'm willing to work hard to be so. I'm not really killing it at life or superbly financially responsible. I have some anxiety and depression (and kinda froze up at the response this got). But I feel compelled to try anyway, (especially while drinking apparently). And there is no harm in trying other than a lifetime of embarrassment for me, my friends and family.

I first I was pretty discouraged with overwhelming negative responses, but hey, upvotes don't lie so I guess I'm going to go forward with it over at /r/automationparty. I'm currently traveling home for the holidays but over the next few days I'm going to copy the good questions here and put them into an FAQ over there.

Jumping ahead, for Earth to be one unified government, all pre-existing countries would have to have the same idea for a system of government. I highly doubt that an absolute monarchy and a presidential republic will agree on a system of government unless it's a constitutional monarchy with an executive head of state.

It should really be possible.,"The idea of uploading my brain to computer never sat well with me at first. I didn't understand how a being recreated using my memories would still be *me*. I've thought about it a lot, and I've changed my mind on the subject. The mind uploaded to the computer and later recreated in another being would still be me.

Question: ""Would it not just be someone else living in your body with your memories, while you are long gone and dead?""

Answer: This question makes absolutely no sense. Any instance of a brain with my thoughts will not only feel like it is me, it *is* me. Think about yourself dazing off, or day dreaming. You can forget yourself, for a few seconds. Then someone wakes you up, and now you're alert. Think about what might have happened there. Your brain might as well have turned to mush, and then rebuild itself, once again accessing all your memories. You brain, when it is active, is performing magical, not-yet-understood chemical reactions that allow the simultaneous miracle and tragedy of being able to **feel**. When you combine that with your cohesive memories that are based in reality, and are able to predict and make sense of reality, reality *makes sense* and you're online. You're you.


Now whenever my brain is uploaded to a computer and put in another body, I'll have woken up from my day dream, accessed my cohesive memory of reality with higher-dimensional historical experiences, and some chemical reactions will take place and I'll snap awake. ",,1485
832,325u1x,2015-04-10,text,text,Yuli-Ban,Imagine A Classless Future,"*Insert Mother Meki nonsense here* Since this is Reddit, no one yet knows about Mother Meki. That's a novel series I'm working on; I'm almost finished the first draft of the first book. Might see a release next year?
But screw that.


So I've been thinking more about my little system, 'Technostism.' That is, syndicalism (worker ownership of businesses, a la workplace democracy, but not a complete or even really a partial abandonment of free enterprise) + automation (robots and AI are the real working class, doing most or all of our drudgery) + a universal basic income (which is added to syndicalism, which is sort of like a doubling up of a UBI). 

I want to go on about technostism, but this thread isn't about that. It's about imagining a classless future.  IMO, technostism is the best way for classlessness to work. It's been shown time and time again that socialism as it is now just won't work--- exceptionally--- that is, with  the extreme (if lopsided) success of capitalist nations. Don't believe the extreme right, it does work. Cuba shows that socialism can indeed last a very long time successfully. However, the socialist idea of 'success' is vastly different from the capitalist or technostic idea of success. A socialist economy is mostly stagnant, but if handled properly, you won't see any depressions or recessions. Stuff just doesn't change. Cuban socialism works as intended--- though USica has abandoned  it, the world has kept its economy up over the decades. The issue with all dominant-socialist economies being that you're just not going to see any real wealth creation, and if you get the wrong strain of socialism, you don't get Cuba--- you get North Korea. You think USica or the UK is class stratified? North Korea is, in my opinion, Airstrip One brought to life in full. Utterly technomedieval, where there aren't just classes but castes. The kind of horrorshow the extreme left defends since it's not Western capitalism. Hence my whole 'socialism is hydroxide; technostism is dihydrogen monoxide' analogy. Doesn't matter what you mix hydroxide with--- you try to drink it, you're going to die.
But no, it's a given that human nature as is doesn't beget classlessness. We have too much of our primate ancestry in our blood, and we will retain much of it even into posthumanhood. Seeing as I like being a primate, I have no real problem with this. But it's blatantly obvious that class war is a real thing, and income inequality threatens the very stability of Western (and Eastern!) civilization. Remedying this doesn't mean going total Harrison Bergeron/2081 and having everyone be so utterly equal that even having your synapses fire faster means you're extensively punished--- IMHO, income inequality is a thing because wages didn't rise equally. If there were income equality, yes, there'd still be ""rich and poor"" in USica. The extreme right wants to twist it to say it's a communist idea to make everyone earn the exact same amount of money— which is completely getting the discussion wrong. If there were no income inequality the average ""poor"" person would be taking home over $200,000 a year by this point. Obviously there'd still be billionaires and millionaires. Income for the rich will have risen dramatically by 2015, but equally so for the poor and middle class.  Instead, income for the rich has risen unbelievably--- but the poor and middle class have not seen any gains. In some cases, they've seen their income fall. That's income inequality and class warfare, not ""kill the rich and give to freeloaders"" some say it is. And it only winds up hurting the rich as well--- if your consumers have less money and more debt, what happens when they can't afford to pay you? Jail them? There's only so many you can jail before everything collapses and your billions (and possibly you) turn to ashes. The extreme right doesn't even want to talk about it, and mentioning that it could end in violent revolution gets you an earful of ""Why do you want blood and heads to roll so badly?!"" The extreme left capitalizes on this to say we should strive to be more like failed worker's states.

If we had a truly classless society today, we wouldn't have this problem or potential future threat. As I said earlier, there's no doubt that classlessness today will be impossible to maintain simply because of the state of our civilization and technology. Until we achieve technostism, it just won't happen. 



But whatever. All that I was just ranting and raving about? Whatever. It's been discussed so many times before now. I couldn't care less about that at this point. What I'm more interested in is what a classless society would actually look like once it does become sustainable.

I already said that technostism is the best way. Whereas fascism is the worst of both worlds (worst, statist elements of socialism and worst, classist elements of capitalism), technostism is the best (best, social elements of socialism and best, wealth-creating elements of capitalism) simply because of its very design--- there's  no doubt that slavery could be a great thing--- if we could only just not use people as slaves. What about machines? What if everyone owned machines in common? Imagine if the whole of humanity were the bourgeoisie. Athens was so amazing because all the great thinkers and doers were freed from labor  thanks to slaves.  
Imagine a new Athens, where all humans are wealthy and free and semi-intelligent machines are responsible for 99%+ of all necessary labor. Like I said, we can't do this with socialism because socialism as it exists today lacks a machine working class, so inevitably there will be a class of people who exploit others' labor for their own benefit. They'd call it by another name and insist it's not capitalism, as had happened so many times before.  If you accept mediocrity as success, then socialism works. If you actually want progress, then free enterprise and technostism are what you're looking for.

So yes, just imagine. 

Mother Meki was wrought because I felt (erroneously) that no one cared about what comes after. Successful social revolution is not how the story ends, but how it starts. Particularly from the POV of someone from the ex-elite who very much desires a popular order. I.e. it goes from dystopian to demitopian** over time. Things change. What we have now is clearly unpopular and many wish to change it— but with what? What happens next?

Even the prices at places like Seoul and Saigon are skyrocketing.

Investors with cash buy up properties. They can borrow from the bank to cover the payments, and write off the losses as tax savings. They can wait forever, because if they hold empty properties the rest of their holdings can charge higher rent.

​

Then the rentiers buy properties in the boondocks, evict those who can't pay their much higher rent, house those who left the big cities and still have enough money to live in the boondocks, etc.

​

They will rent to those who can pay, say, $100,000/month. Supply and demand no longer work, since demand can only rise while supply will be even more restricted. It is like Martin Shkreli's logic - hey, if you have to pay 2/3 of your net worth to save your life, there is no choice other than pay it up or die.

​

Given the speed price of Bay Area real estate, plus London, NYC, etc are rising (doubling up every two years, kind of the new Moore's Law) $5,000 now will be about $160,000 in 10 years, so I was actually underestimating the increase.

​

Smart, inimical techies and rentiers will have no mercy over those who cannnot pay their higher price, although they will gladly welcome anyone who will be able to pay their higher rents from the money they earn from tech, investment, trading, etc. We will see lots of empty lots, like Las Vegas during Howard Hughes' lifetime (he left lots of the city empty because he wanted to wait until the price increased), in the major cities I mentioned above in the future. If the politicians oppose such move, they will be replaced by those who are more likely to do the rentiers' bidding. After all, as late as 150 years ago, landowners were free to kill, burn and maim tenants who refused to leave, with the police (dependent upon the rentiers' tax payments for their living) turning a blind eye, and sympathetic police members turning up dead in brothels, etc. with no explanations. That's how Civilization works.

​

The public be damned - remember, just 100 years ago the Fifth Avenue in new York was full of millionaire's mansions, and we will also see a repeat of it as well.

​

As tech improves, the wealth of the tech-drivers and the rentiers, who are not stupid and invest on stocks of the tech drivers as diversification, will increase while those who are dependent upon fixed income will end up like the pensioners of ex-Soviet Russia in 1990s when their buying power was cut from, say, $500 to $10.

​

The Rentiers will employ both competent personnel and state-of-art surveillance tools to deal with squatters, who will be like the birds who were killed by Mao Tsetung's kill-the-birds campaign. (The peasants would beat gongs to prevent the birds from resting, and the birds, exhausted, would simply fall from the sky to die.)

​

Some say tech will make where you live moot. Sorry, to be able to earn higher income, one does have to be in some location. Warren Buffett can live in Omaha because , well, he is Warren Buffett. That luxury will not extend to those who are not already an elite today. Some stock guru living in the boondocks will want to eat good food, ride fast cars, shag supermodels, etc and if he doesn't feel like it, chances are he will be visited by some thugs who will want his money, forcing him to move to more expensive but safer centers of Civilization.

844,955qk5,2018-08-06,Discussion,discussion,carlos8983,Why it's foolish to assert that aliens exist.,"I've seen and heard plenty of people stating that 'aliens must exist' and 'anyone that doesn't think aliens exist is an idiot'. People mostly assert that since there are billions upon billions of stars, it is silly to think that there isn't a few where, like earth, life has began. While I don't think it's sensible to rule out the existence of aliens, I also think that it is foolish to assert that they exist, at least as strongly as most people do today. 

The main problem is our lack of data; we have absolutely no idea how life on Earth began. Yes there are some theories about it but the truth is that we have no idea about the actual process that first caused life to begin. For that reason, we also have no idea about how likely it is for this process to occur. Say there are 200 billion galaxies in the universe; what if the chance of life beginning are 1 in 500 billion or even greater? What if we are lucky that life in the universe exists at all?

The truth is that we simply don't know. To this date, there has been absolutely no evidence of any kind of life beyond our planet. There are many proposed solutions to the Fermi paradox, but what if the simplest is the correct one, what if there simply isn't any life anywhere else? It is certainly not impossible that other life in the universe exists, but as it stands there is absolutely no reason to firmly believe that it does.",,1393

Just writing this before I forget. I don't think this is the most plausible, but maybe an interesting concept.

We are now using AI to beat humans at very complex and interesting, relevant games such as Chess, Go, Super Mario, and Dota. The way we train the AI is by dividing it and making it face itself over and over again until it becomes better and better right? Well doesn't that sound a lot like what life is? And especially for modern humans? We pass our genes along, and insert random variations which potentially improve the code. We make our children face their children, and their children theirs. What if we pit father against son, mother against daughter in epic struggles for conflict, forgiveness and redemption. (This is where things get even weirder) What if our children are those that we most sinned against a previous life? And afterwards you go over in a life review and see if there is reason for forgiveness? And you reverse roles and go again and learn again? What if the Nazi who murdered the Jew became the father in the next life, and the son judged his father after his death? What are the lessons learned for the algorithm?

[Exodus 34:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A7&version=ESV)

Keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.”

What if this could combine the doctrine of Christian forgiveness, and the concept of reincarnation? The same way our various countries are uniting now, and learning to unite to create a viable future... we will either learn to get along, or learn to destroy ourselves. Just in the same way, that we will likely come together to create the code that is mixed together with all of our ancestral instincts and DNA to create a heaven on earth.

What if the technological explosion already happened? What if in 2012 the singularity already happened and this weird world that has emerged in recent years is one of many fragments of trillions of our universes that were created for the sole purpose of improving the original world? Could this make sense of the recently conceived many worlds, or quantum immortality?",,2304

http://greyenlightenment.com/gnons-wager/

> There are one of two outcomes: societal collapse (IMHO, unlikely)

–or–

transition to type-1 civilization in which the aforementioned companies [i.e. GOOG, AMZN, etc] dominate and “capital” continues to grow relative to total global wealth.

==

Current trends won't change - the advantages of today's winners are too great for any new competition to overcome.

Hopefully, the world will literally sleepwalk its way into Singularity and the next level of spacefaring civilization, with no change of status for most people. Today's standard of living for most people is set, with most people facing penury and destitution. But the winners of the Techno-feudal civilization will conquer the space.

However, again, resource is the one and only remaining limiting factor, and if we continue to spend current amount of resources while not reaching the next level of civ, we will meet a sudden, irreversible collapse which will probably do away humanity by 2040 or so.

Since current trends won't change and nobody is going to implement my idea of pricing out most of the world's pop from future gadgets, we will probably hit an iceberg by 2035-40 if the new tech to take us to the next dimension is not there yet.

We can't just 'muddle along' for a long time, because resources are getting consumed as of this moment while infrastructure laid out in the last half century will fall apart sooner or later.

So the world must either supercharge to reach the next level of civ, or face collapse. It is like a poker tournament in which a player cannot sit still for a long time, since the rising blinds will consume the initial number of chips.",,1928
859,2wq1hv,2015-02-21,text,text,msltoe,"My ""visions"" of the future","I have had many opportunities where I have become lucid in a dream and asked to see the future. Now, to most of you, what I am experiencing is nothing more than a clever rendering of my subconscious. Regardless of what you believe, I would like to share some of my observations which you can comment on. The ideas are compiled from several of my ""trips.""

1) In a not-too-far vision that I had in ~2005, I was holding a two-sided flexible paper-thin tablet. Rotating the tablet from one side to the other was like a turning-page gesture.

2) About 100 years into the future - people appear youthful - roughly in their twenties. They seem like they have an awful lot of free time on their hands. Many of them seem cheerful. When I ask them about history they don't always have answers - almost like they are purposefully dumb to certain things.  Still, some people are curious and like to explore science and technologies.  (Side note: I was able to get a straight answer on Obama's re-election - this was around 2010. The 2016 president's name sounded unfamiliar like ""Polento"" - which I realize could either point towards Pawlenty, Clinton, or someone else we aren't aware of yet.)

3) Computers and other electronics appear to be non-existent except when I encounter the scientist-types.  I postulate that electronics is mostly invisible to the eye. Sometimes I see things that seem like their violating the laws of physics (at small scales - like a  strangely functioning guitar), which could well be just be nanotechnologies embedded in everyday life.

4) I often ask what year it is. The answer I get is sometimes surprising. It is not 2000 such and such, but a smaller number. When I ask why it isn't in the 2000 range, they say that it's a new epoch. I hypothesize that I might be tapping into a VR world - see next point.

5) It appears that I am sometimes exploring a multi-hierarchical virtual reality. In other words, a VR on top of a VR, etc. Still, people look like people - at least what I can remember or process.

6) Aliens visit us (seems like several hundred years in the future) to share with us knowledge about the rest of the universe - and even how and why this universe came into being - offering their G-d hypothesis/evidence.

7) A particularly bizarre experience which I thought was about 500 years into the future, is where I meet a man who called himself Yahweh (sound familiar?) who claimed he was creating a universe in his laboratory. The thought that came to my mind at the time was that civilization becomes sufficiently intelligent in the future to go back in time a create the Universe it exists in - talk about circular reasoning!

862,2qqexc,2014-12-29,text,text,Yuli-Ban,We must crush the Luddite Fallacy,"The infamous Luddite Fallacy will get people killed if it's not done away with. Most likely the conservative rich, those who refuse any changes are taking place. 

You've seen it before. It's prevalent on any thread where automation, basic income, and future social issues are the topic. 

""The jobs robots take will create *new* jobs for us!""

and

""There are jobs AI just cannot do, no matter how advanced.""

This, in itself, will become a fallacy. I call it ""the Technostic Fallacy"" after a term I created describing an AI labor driven economy, technostism. It's most prevalent amongst AI critics, spiritualists, the luddite/hippie left, and hard right conservative capitalists because of how completely it sweeps away their worldviews. 
I'd hate to be them come 2030.  

AI critics will say that AI is impossible— we'd need to program every single thing they do, and even the most creative programmers couldn't account for everything. 
Deep learning smacks them to the ground. The whole point of neural nets is to allow *the world* to program AI. That's how it works for us biologicals— we have some presets, and then we're out. Your life is one big string of programming, 99.9% of it done by other people, places, things, events...

There is a thought experiment I like to play. I call it the parable of the capitalists. In this scenario, you have one business that hires humans, and another that has just bought an AI after laying off its workers. The executive of the human-labor business sees the profits the executive of the AI-labor company is dozing in and decides to lay off his workforce in order to buy a better AI. One month later, both executives are standing in an AI-run bread line with their former workers.

What happened? Simple— the second executive was getting rich off the paychecks of the first executive's workers. When the first executive fired his workers, there was no money in circulation. No economy. The workers were destitute, unable to get a job since AI was so vastly superior to them in any possible field. The capitalist executives, thus, couldn't make any profits and lost all their money. Imagine this on a **global** scale.

Right now, this seems to be our future because people refuse to accept that it will happen. They're sure those workers are just lazy bums who didn't try hard enough, and those capitalists were too stupid to hold onto their wealth. Or maybe that robots and AI will *never* become that capable. Even if they do, there's just something ""special"" about human interaction.

This kind of thinking will do us in. Try to imagine a solution to the parable, any way you so choose. Just remember that the AI will ***not*** create jobs that they, themselves or similar models, cannot do.  They're fallacy-proof. 

Edit: A thousand thanks for the gold. Forgot to mention **transhumanism**.

When we develop AI, there's no doubt we ought be able to augment ourselves to a point well beyond human. I still feel that won't be enough. At best, transhumanism will be necessary to ward off a *Wall-E* dystopian future, maybe increase our ability to create art and understand the universe. When we become posthuman (those who choose to), then I feel labor won't rank very high on our priorities.

By then, we'd likely have nanotechnology capable of nanomining and molecular fabrication, rendering even robots obsolete.",,3363

I always like to start out on this topic by quoting [Davila:](http://don-colacho.blogspot.com/2010/07/1438.html)

>The problem is not sexual repression, nor sexual liberation, but sex.

Now, the funny thing is, Davila is about as far away from a transhumanist as you can get, however he hits the nail on the head right there.

Most problems in human society originate out of the fact that humans are separated into two mutually dependent genders. Postmodernists recognize this, but then seek to solve it by denying the existence of gender, and declaring that we can be any gender we want, and others have to accept this, but this does not work, as our brains are inherently gendered.

We can't even begin to imagine what a society without gender would look like, because almost all of our behavior has gender at its roots, including our most destructive behavior.

Physiological differences exists between the genders, making it impossible for us to function on our own. Men and women depend on each other for a variety of reasons, from reproduction to emotional validation and anything in between. Genders are only defined in their relation to each other, as there is no universal standard of masculinity or femininity. However, it is this interdependence that leads to most human problems. 

The solution to this is to abolish gender through biotechnology, and give rise to a post-gender asexual organism. This is the direction that evolution is already taking. [Human digit ratio's as an example have converged, indicating that gender ambiguity is increasing over the course of human evolution.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/)

An example of this desire for post-genderism can be seen in most of Lady Gaga's work. Nearly all of Lady Gaga's work refers to a desire to overcome the gender dichotomy that has enchained human consciousness. Lady Gaga visits male transvestites, dresses up as a man, and her own gender has been questioned by many.

If we look at her video, [Alejandro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA), we find a critique of the existence of gender itself, and an appeal to human enhancement, through use of symbolism.

The first shot at 0:06 we see in this video is of a sleeping man wearing fishnet stockings.

We then see a fascist demonstration carrying a star of David, followed by Gaga in what appears to be cyborg gear. We then see her leading a funeral procession, carrying the sacred heart, representing her having beaten God and destroying his design, with a man with a helmet shown with wires to indicate that masculinity has become a relic of the past.

Eventually we see Gaga sodomizing men, her dancing with machine guns on her breasts (a symbolic appeal to the inherent connection between sex and violence if there ever was one). The video culminates in Gaga appearing as a sort of messianic androgynous figure in a monk's robe. The lyrics meanwhile reference Lady Gaga overcoming the chains of femininity and as a result gaining power over men through her indifference towards them.

Then comes the most important scene where she covers her eye with a hand, referencing the replacement of duality by unity and internalized harmony. We then see footage of war and violence ending in a revisiting of the soldier in female dress, which is then followed by Gaga being ravaged by naked men, indicating a return to barbarity. This ends in her being displayed lying dead on a bed with wires, indicating that her androgynous dictatorial regime has come to an end.

Why is this? The theme of overcoming gender duality is very popular among artists. This is largely because artists have androgynous brains for which the rest of society has no use, and homosexuals are drawn to the arts because their infertility requires of them to leave a mark on the world through non-reproductive means.

898,48z5by,2016-03-04,text,text,TroyHallewell,Am I the only one who feels this way?,"One Day 99% of humanity could be wiped out and we haven’t done a damn thing to prepare for it.

Fiction is full of stories about the end of the world via bombs, asteroids, EMP’s, viruses and more. As far as entertainment is concerned we humans need no help imaging creative ways we may die.

But while we are great at thinking up ways it might happen, we’ve been pretty terrible at planning for its eventuality.

With so many things that could send mankind back into the stone age, why aren’t we doing anything about ‘saving our progress’ or ‘saving the game’?

Ok. Deep breath. Let me try this all over again.

If you’ve sat down to write a paper for school or played a video game you understand the importance of saving your progress. If you don’t want to play the same levels over and over again then you need to save the damn game. Likewise, the last thing you want to happen after typing the final line of a twenty-page paper is to have the computer crash and lose all your work.

But that is exactly what we’re doing as a culture.

Still doesn’t make sense? Let me try another approach. The Sumerians were a people who lived over 5000 years ago. Regardless of the how long ago their culture flourished we can tell you what the average Sumerian life was like. Historians can tell you about their likes and dislikes, what foods they ate, who they argued and fought with, what they argued about, how much they paid in taxes and to who, jokes they told (yeah! We have 5000-year-old jokes) how they went to school, what they taught at school, how much grain could be traded for a goat and on and on and on. I won’t lie, most the things we know about ancient Sumer wouldn’t necessarily leave us in a substantially darker world if we didn’t know them, but regardless, it’s amazing how much we know about a people that lived SO LONG AGO!

Compare that to Alexander the Great. He lived 2500 years ago and is one of the most famous humans to have ever lived. Want to know what we know about him? Not much. While a comprehensive retelling of every single detail we know about ancient Sumeria might fill volumes of books, the same level of retelling Alexander’s story might be covered in a well-written HBO mini-series.

Why?

Why do we know so much about the Sumerians even tough they aren’t “famous” and lived over 5000 years ago, yet so little about Alexander the Great, arguably one of the most famous men who ever lived, and who only lived 2500 years ago?

The answer is simple.

Because the Sumerians kept their records written on clay tablets.
 
Alexander’s records were written on paper.

That’s it. That’s the big secret. The great “reveal”. If we want our knowledge and stories to last we need to store them using a process that doesn’t degrade, break down, grow mold or decompose.

Clay tablets are good. Stone tablets are better.

Paper is shitty.

But do you want to know the worst way to save information long term? The #1 way to guarantee it won’t be ANY good to humanity in the event of a near species ending disaster such as an asteroid or other global cataclysm?

In bits and bytes.

Computers… Hard Drives… Thumb drives, CD’s and “The Cloud”.

Think about it. If you had information today stored on a 10-year-old cell phone you’d be screwed. Say bye-bye. Now imagine the difficulty of attempting to access information from a device that is ten decades old, or ten centuries!

Humans have progressed to a state of scientific advancement and knowledge that truly rivals what the Gods were believed to have been like thousands of years ago. We’ve put people on the damn moon! We’ve wiped out entire diseases that used to scourge humanity! We’ve invented machines that fly and homes that keep themselves cool! We’ve increased the quality and duration of life for the average person in a way that, though still leaving much room to improve, is astounding!

Yet, if one big enough asteroid enters the atmosphere its BOOM… It’s back to the stone age! Thanks for playing! Now let’s start hitting rocks together and try to learn this whole ‘science’ thing all over again!

All our knowledge, which is currently stored on paper (at best) and in bits and bytes (at worst) will be gone! One hundred years after the destruction when the first of the few remaining human survivors start poking their heads out of their caves what kind of world is going to be waiting for them? A world with ZERO scientific knowledge remaining because no one thought it important enough to save it. In a world of vaccines, MRI’s, satellites and internet no one thought it was important enough to SAVE THE DAMN GAME! So what should we do about it?

The same thing the Sumerians did. We write it on stone! No, I’m not talking about using stone tablets instead of android tablets in our day to day lives. I love technology! What I’m talking about is something much more doable. I’m talking about 2–3 locations, strategically chosen around the globe due to likelihood of surviving an almost species ending destruction (think asteroid impact), and using those locations as repositories of humanity’s knowledge, engraved on stone tablets (or clay… if we’re not worried about being classy). I mean, we’ve got a “seed vault” in Norway in case something serious happens to humanity, but we have no “scientific knowledge” vault anywhere on earth! That means if something happens in the future and some stone age future humans ever find the seed vault they’re not going have enough knowledge to know what to do with it!

This could be done so cheaply! For 30 million dollars our government could help make sure that in the event of the destruction of 99.9% of humanity that the culmination of our scientific knowledge from the last 7000 years would not be lost. How much is 30 million dollars? Only about 1/40th the cost of the Dallas Cowboys stadium! I mean, I love football, don’t get me wrong, but maybe our priorities are a little bit out of whack here? And what if the government doesn’t want to do it? What if we’re too scared to admit that there is a slight chance that in another 100 years, or 500 years, that humanity as we know it might not even exist anymore? That’s a hard pill to swallow, and when it comes to politicians who wants to vote for the pessimist anyway? Well, then a rich businessman or businesswoman could step in and carry the weight for all of us. For 30 million dollars I could give them a 1 in 100 chance that they will become the most revered human in the history of the human race.

Think about that for a moment…

For 30 million they could have a 1 in 100 chance of saving the sum of our scientific knowledge from the last 7000 years for humanity in the future to access.

They would save humanity who knows how many thousands of years of cultural and scientific evolution and progression… and during the process cause their name to be known for millenniums to come. Move over Alexander! Move over Caesar! At that point, the person who will have done the greatest good for the human race will be Mr. Fill-In-The-Blank-It-Only-Cost-Me-Thirty-Million businessman.

But what if we can’t get the government to do it and we can’t get a rich businessman to fund it? Then we create a grassroots effort! We go to the people (at least the reasonable ones who can acknowledge that tomorrow just might bring something more than we’re able to cope with) and we get people and corporations to sponsor the project individually. We raise $1000 here and $1000 there. Hell, we can take sponsorships of individual tablets of information if that’s what it takes to get the job done… “This is how electricity works… but first, a word from our sponsor, Coca-Cola!”…ah… maybe General Electric would be better... I don’t care, if corporate sponsorship is what it takes to save the sum of human knowledge then so be it! Anything is better than what we have now. Which is exactly jack-shit! Nothing. Zilch. Nada. It was nice while it lasted.

So where do we start? What do we do? We need to talk about it. We need to create a dialogue. I can admit that maybe I just might be a crazy man, maybe my arguments aren’t as clear as they seem to me. But if so, lets talk about it. Because while we should never live our lives expecting the near extinction of the human race as we know it, perhaps we owe it to those who will come afterward to make sure they aren’t left a world devoid of scientific knowledge. We need to have a conversation. We need to plan for the future. In the last 10 millenniums, we’ve come from the dawn of agriculture to sending robots to Mars. But what happens if the power goes out…

…tomorrow?

We need to SAVE THE DAMN GAME!",,8623

One very little known fact is that Russia, out of all countries, was a major destination for scientists and technicians during the 18th century.

Russia was not exactly considered as part of Western Civ until Peter the Great opened that country to the West and invited as many Westerners as possible.

Although there were setbacks (Russian reactionaries tried to turn back the clock by moving the capital back to Moscow and putting a grandson of Peter I to the throne to reverse all of the reforms - thankfully that boy-czar was poisoned before he did any real damages),

Petersburg became a hotbed of science and tech, which also housed, out of all people, Bernhard Euler. Unfortunately he left there during the time the above incident took place.

The Romanov dynasty ended on 1763 (although the name was kept till 1918 all Czars after Catharine II were Germans), but still Petersburg was a good place to get away from the turmoils of Europe with strong protection from the Czar. 

They did not mingle with the local population, and Czar's guards made sure nobody messed with these more advanced people. Eventually their descendants became quite dominant in Russian politics, science, and tech, until the Russian Revolution killed or drove almost all of them out.

===

As Europe gets hotter with turmoils, it is likely that ambitious and smart Europeans will find themselves in China, Hong Kong or Singapore where they can walk at night.

HK and Singapore always had a sizable Western enclave; the people living there keep separate from the locals, and the police take a good care of the locals who try to mess with them. Same for the richer Chinese cities like Shanghai or Canton.

With the arrival of smarter Europeans who long to be safe, combined with local talents, it is possible that China (the other two locals are under Chinese influence) could get to the Singularity faster than any Westerner could imagine. 

China has no concern over 'human rights' and other bullshit, and could do a Manhattan Project without answering to its people. And, with the addition of the Europeans fleeing the 'refugees' for a safer location,

(it is likely that parts of the major Chinese cities will be reserved for these new arrivals, with existing inhabitants forcibly removed, something unthinkable in the West but very common in Asia)

Xi Jinping of China will get a reputation of Catharine II of Russia, an ""Enlightened Despot"". 

That's why the West has to speed up on singularity - if the West won't, China will.

This extra traffic should gradually be offset by more even traffic flow as self driving cars become the majority of vehicles on the road and all those unused parking lots would be trees or solar parks.  

Edit. I'm talking about self driving taxis that replace private car journeys.

Edit: Another point is all the train and bus traffic could migrate to the comfort and privacy and safety of self driven taxis as they will be cheaper than the train and door to door against the bus. 

Edit: As it's impractical to turn railways into roads as they take very heavy freight like huge bulk stone and coal. Something roads can't do.  If the railways have few passengers, I'm beginning to think the increase in traffic could be huge with cheap self driving taxis.

903,34pqui,2015-05-03,text,text,IntelligenceIsReal,How will society be able to program human values into AI when everyone's values are different?,"As AI advances and humans increasingly become dependent on it and other technology, trying to establish a common value system for people globally will be a very convulsive process:

For example, for the vegan, eating meat is not in his or her value system.  For the radical Muslim, one who is not of his or her religion is may be considered sub human.  A similar argument can be made for the radical Zionist or any radical of any religion.  Heck, even the concept of radical is a value.

Humans have been programmed into their current value systems over centuries of cultural evolution.  Initially it was accepted that the King should own everyone and everything by a power conferred from god, or divine right.  In America it used to be the accepted that women and African Americans should be the property of white men.

The complexity and interdependency of human values has only grown over time.  In some instances we have evolved for the better, and others gone backwards while new environmental issues have developed with advances in industrialization.  

We all have different beliefs and values depending how we were programmed as children and how we have programmed ourselves through the present.

Going forward, trying to create a common value system consistent with the progress of AI and other technology will require finding beliefs everyone can agree upon.

In order to avoid what could be the most violent conflict in human history, a good start might be the golden rule:  *to treat others as you would want to be treated.*",,1536

Furthermore, if we use classical computers, algorithms, and neural networks to retrieve, store, and run human data, the results will probably be ineffective at best. We’re quantum beings living in a quantum universe, classical computations don’t translate. But quantum computing isn’t limited by the binary thinking necessary for classical systems to operate. In 1989, Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose proposed that no standard, classical model of computing would ever explain how the brain produces thought and conscious experience. The suggestion intrigued a lot of people, not least an Arizona-based anaesthetist called Stuart Hameroff, who suggested a specific way for quantum effects to get involved.

The crux of the idea was that microtubules – protein tubes that make up neurons’ support structure – exploit quantum effects to exist in “superpositions” of two different shapes at once. Each of these shapes amounts to a bit of classical information, so this shape-shifting quantum bit, or qubit, can store twice as much information as its classical counterpart.

Add quantum entanglement to the mix – a quantum feature that allows qubit states to remain intertwined even when not in contact – and you rapidly build a quantum computer that can manipulate and store information far more efficiently than any classical computer. Adding that in the 1990s, long before winning the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for his prediction of black holes, physicist Roger Penrose teamed up with anaesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff to propose an ambitious answer.

They claimed that the brain’s neuronal system forms an intricate network and that the consciousness this produces should obey the rules of quantum mechanics – the theory that determines how tiny particles like electrons move around. This, they argue, could explain the mysterious complexity of human consciousness.

The Penrose-Hameroff theory of quantum consciousness argues that microtubules are structured in a fractal pattern which would enable quantum processes to occur.

Fractals are structures that are neither two-dimensional nor three-dimensional, but are instead some fractional value in between. In mathematics, fractals emerge as beautiful patterns that repeat themselves infinitely, generating what is seemingly impossible: a structure that has a finite area, but an infinite perimeter.This might sound impossible to visualise, but fractals actually occur frequently in nature. If you look closely at the florets of a cauliflower or the branches of a fern, you’ll see that they’re both made up of the same basic shape repeating itself over and over again, but at smaller and smaller scales. That’s a key characteristic of fractals. According to what him said “We’re not yet able to measure the behaviour of quantum fractals in the brain – if they exist at all. But advanced technology means we can now measure quantum fractals in the lab. In recent research involving a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), my colleagues at Utrecht and I carefully arranged electrons in a fractal pattern, creating a quantum fractal.

When we then measured the wave function of the electrons, which describes their quantum state, we found that they too lived at the fractal dimension dictated by the physical pattern we’d made. In this case, the pattern we used on the quantum scale was the Sierpiński triangle, which is a shape that’s somewhere between one-dimensional and two-dimensional.

This was an exciting finding, but STM techniques cannot probe how quantum particles move – which would tell us more about how quantum processes might occur in the brain. So in our latest research, my colleagues at Shanghai Jiaotong University and I went one step further. Using state-of-the-art photonics experiments, we were able to reveal the quantum motion that takes place within fractals in unprecedented detail.

We achieved this by injecting photons (particles of light) into an artificial chip that was painstakingly engineered into a tiny Sierpiński triangle. We injected photons at the tip of the triangle and watched how they spread throughout its fractal structure in a process called quantum transport. We then repeated this experiment on two different fractal structures, both shaped as squares rather than triangles. And in each of these structures we conducted hundreds of experiments.

Our observations from these experiments reveal that quantum fractals actually behave in a different way to classical ones. Specifically, we found that the spread of light across a fractal is governed by different laws in the quantum case compared to the classical case.

This new knowledge of quantum fractals could provide the foundations for scientists to experimentally test the theory of quantum consciousness. If quantum measurements are one day taken from the human brain, they could be compared against our results to definitely decide whether consciousness is a classical or a quantum phenomenon.

Our work could also have profound implications across scientific fields. By investigating quantum transport in our artificially designed fractal structures, we may have taken the first tiny steps towards the unification of physics, mathematics and biology, which could greatly enrich our understanding of the world around us as well as the world that exists in our heads.“

Stars. I'm looking for educated and constructive ideas on it's plausibility and scientific accuracy.

Cant change the title, but this is a **thought experiment**, not a theory by scientific definition.

*G'day all!*

I have been toying with this idea in my head today and wanted to get an honest opinion about the validity of my idea as a plausible theory regarding the propagation of life throughout the universe.

I have not found anything similar after a not so exhaustive search so I thought I'd come here.

**I call the idea, ""Stellar Biogenesis"".**

In it's most simplified form, the idea postulates that a form (or multiple forms) of life could exist within the atmosphere of stars. This is *not a new idea* and scientists have speculated many times in the past that life may take a form currently unrecognizable to us as life. They have proposed that it may inhabit ultra-extreme environments from atmospheric life on Venus and Jupiter, to oceanic organisms inhabiting subterranean oceans on Europa and beyond, all the way to exotic life that might exist within the strange matter at the heart of neutron stars. In keeping true to this line of thought, and maintaining an open mind as to the nature of life itself...

I postulate that **s*****hould*** life be possible in ***any*** form within the confines of a star, that logically:

**1.)** Due to the fact that stars existed long before the formation of planetary systems and galaxies, life \*as we *do not* understand it currently\* should have existed not long after the formation of the first stars began stellar fusion in the aftermath of the big bang.

**2.)** This ""precursor"" life would have been an extremely durable extremophile. Just like such life that exists today, it may have been partially or fully immune to the effects of extreme temperature or gravity. This would suggest that it would also be immune to the effects of the vacuum of space, as many bacteria and single celled organisms do today.

**3.)** The discrete properties of the environs within a star (extreme as they are) may be the very catalyst for life itself, a revelation which would clarify why we have yet to recreate biogenesis in a laboratory.

**4.)** Stellar evolution and the catastrophic destruction of stars through events like collisions, novae, supernovae, and even prominences and outgassing, would likely have ejected massive quantities of this ""precursor"" life away from themselves in all directions in addition to the inorganic material that we are already aware of.

**5.)** From the first ""living"" stars until now, this materiel would have been the building blocks of all planetary systems and intra-galactic structures which exist today. It is known that most of the matter that exists in the observable universe has existed for quite some time, and is the result of stellar fusion and gravity from the first stars which formed in the primordial universe.

**6.)** That as the universe expanded, stars continued to seed this life and matter in all directions, forming the planets and bodies that exist now and seeding them with the original blueprints for self replicating biology. This, therefore, can be construed as being the origin of life throughout the entire universe.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This hypothesis may be supported by the well established understanding that life first appeared on Earth very shortly after the planet reached hydrostatic equilibrium and cooled. It stands in opposition to the idea that life began spontaneously and in a single localized event. Arguably, the existence of a ""precursor"" life form would better explain why it happened so quickly and ambiguously. It would also act as a serious antithesis to the concept of a ""*unique* *Earth*"" among the multitudinous cosmos. Furthermore, it necessarily implies that life in the universe must be ubiquitous and come from a common point of temporal and cosmographic origin in the Stelliferous Era.

It may or may not be supported by the theory that early life on Earth began in the oceans around hydrothermal vents. High ambient pressure (apparent gravity), high temperatures, and elemental heterogeneity are all attributes which are shared to an extent between hydrothermal vents and stars.

If this idea is found to be even partially factual, it could help reestablish the concept of panspermia (although in a different sense), expand our thinking on the nature of Earth and xeno biology, establish new field of study in astronomy and astrophysics, or bring us one step closer to answering one of humanity's oldest and most profound questions. Notwithstanding, keep in mind I am certainly no expert on any of these sciences (I would scarcely consider myself well-informed). This thought experiment was a part of my mental process for attempting to understand the universe and complex topics related to the sciences.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am so sorry about the length of this post. I feel a bit nervous sticking my neck out for this online given that I am unsure if this idea has been established yet, or if I am missing some fundamental scientific knowledge in creating this thesis. It is my hope that some of you may have missing pieces to this puzzle and can help me determine how to move forward.

 It also brings in to play the question of exactly how much authority we should give our A.I. constructs and machine learning algorithms to monitor and safeguard this data.

 In a very real sense, we are creating something akin to ""gods"" here that are omnipresent, omniscient, and nearly all powerful if we are not careful, through the implementation of *the Internet of Things* and a permanent Block Chain ledger of events.

 The real question is: 

 If Block Chain authentication proves to provide an unhackable and incorruptible ledger of events, then how far off are we from adopting it as a form of authentication to access the Internet, Identification in day to day work aspects, and of course perhaps most obviously - financial transactions?

 The people working on both A.I. and Block Chain seem super enthused about what they are doing but I really do wonder; have they thought of a way out if it doesn't work the way that they anticipated?

 Imagine a world 30 years from now as something of a thought experiment where an 18 year old is applying for an academic training program for a lucrative career field (Colleges as we know them may not exist anymore as we know them).

 
Think of the questions that could be asked by the approving Authority and the ruthlessness of the screening process...

 ""Johnny, why did you tape those candy wrappers to your cats' feet when you were 10 years old?""

 - ""because it was funny""

 ""Johnny, remember that time when you were 13 years old when you logged on to an Adult website and claimed you were over 18 years old?  Why did you do that?""

 - ""I did no such thing!""

 ""You did it on April 12, 2043 at 10:15pm PST and remained logged-in for 7 hours""

 - ""I was a kid, why does it matter?""

 ""Because your lying to us Johnny, our scan of your thoughts shows you are defensive and becoming aggressive during this interview, Thank You for applying""

 - ""What???""


*Has anyone really thought this through?  Is this the world we really want to live in?*

 It might seem like a great idea to have a permanent, indisputable record of History and facts but the question of this Post is:

 **Is it?**

964,p62zvq,2021-08-17,Discussion,discussion,Vulknut,"The Self, where to draw the line?"," 

What I’m about to talk about isn’t a new idea. It’s tough to find truly new ideas anymore, but we can still find ideas that are new to us. Which is basically my attempt in writing this. To bring some old ideas into the current light. I don’t have all the answers which is why I’ve selected the discussion flair. I want to hear what you think about these ideas, which have been floating around in my head for some time now.

Everyone in the world has a sense of Self. The sense that this body I inhabit and the mind which houses my thoughts is essentially, my Self. Many people much more intelligent than I have tackled this concept. Carl Jung had some things to say about the conscious and subconscious parts of the mind. He talks about things like the Ego, the Persona, the Shadow, the anima (of men’s minds), and the animus (of women’s minds). He talks of something he calls “the process of self individuation” which at least as I understand it is the process someone goes through in their life as they begin to integrate the different parts of their Self which may be hidden or repressed from the conscious aspect of the mind.

As an example as to how this happens and to show a small part of self individuation, I will use a story about myself. My father was an alcoholic and an angry one at that. I was 19 when I finally was able to get out of the house and for those 19 years I developed a strong resentment and hate for my father and all of the things he did. Namely drinking and expressing anger in any form. Because of that I did everything in my power to cut myself off from these two things. I never expressed anger towards anyone. Even in situations where a certain level of anger would have been the proper response. I was prone to the occasional outburst of anger when I just couldn’t hold it back any longer. I feared the day someone truly made me angry because I didn’t know what I would do to them, I was afraid I would harm them beyond repair.

It wasn’t until I stumbled upon the words of Jung that I began to think more deeply about doing this to myself. Jung says that you must learn to utilize every part of your Self. To cut yourself off from a wealth of emotional energy like, anger, sexuality, sadness, and even happiness, if through certain circumstances you’ve deemed it as something you don’t deserve or as something fundamentally useless, you do yourself a disservice. It would be like building a house with only 3/4ths of the bricks required and wondering why it’s structure is compromised. Unless you learn what it is you’ve cut yourself off from and learn to channel that emotional energy instead of letting it control you, you’re operating at 3/4ths of your potential strength.

Bear with me. I promise I’ll bring all of this back to the title “the Self, where to draw the line”. But first I have to put all of the pieces in place. 

Now, what about the physical self? It obviously plays a massive part in forming a whole self. Despite theories on us becoming an AI copy of ourselves it still won't be our current self. No hormones will exist in that new form, no blood will course through its veins, no micro-biome in its stomach. Which brings me to the next interesting thing we’ve learned. Your body isn’t just your body. It is home to thousands of microorganisms. Which if you decided to cut yourself off from and eradicate from your body you would most assuredly die.

So, let's just say for now, your Self is the collection of the conscious and subconscious parts of the brain, as well as the cells that form your body and brain including the microorganisms that perform fundamental internal functions for your body and brain.

Now, what is the fundamental drive of all of these parts which call itself a Self? Self preservation and Self propagation. We eat, drink, sleep, and learn new things in order to make ourselves better at preserving our Self and to make ourselves more attractive as a mate in order to preserve our species.

This is the point where we go into the point of, where do we draw the line? If the Self’s main drive is self preservation and propagation then why in extreme circumstances do we find ourselves making the split second decision to jump in the way of a car to save a stranger or run into a burning building to save a stranger? Why would we die for our children to live or for someone else’s child to live? That’s not individual self preservation. In that moment we decide it is not me who matters, but the whole. The Whole Self.

I’m here to say that I believe we are all One. Is there a difference between taking the time to remember some old skills you used to have when you were younger and asking someone to remind you how it’s done? Is there a difference between learning a new skill to serve yourself and providing someone the means to educate themselves, so that you can also benefit from their mastery? Do you have anything to lose when you view everyone as an extension of yourself? My gain is your gain, your gain is my gain and together we grow. 

So I ask again, where do we draw the line? Is there or was there ever a line? What do we have to gain from drawing lines between peoples, cultures, genders, sexes, creatures of the Earth, and lines within our own minds and hearts?",,5262

This type of encryption would be purposely weak and could take anywhere from a few minutes to a year or longer to break. The computer or human that carried out the punishment could only punish certain tasks for certain amounts of time. This would vary depending on the punishers place in society (like if it was a police computer or judge computer) and how many computational resources it had. So basically if a human wanted to punish a computer it would have to buy a specialized computer that would carry out punishments,,687

976,1ei1ez,2013-05-16,,,frohlich,5 Reasons I am Opposed to Transhumanism,"*1.) Being Human is special. Transhumanism will take that away.*
Most people dismiss this argument as some sort of religious nonsense, however I do not think this is fair. Humans have the perfect level of physical and mental capabilities where they are largely self-sufficient as an individual on the short term, but require help from other people in order to propagate the species. An interesting caveat is that they also have the mental capabilities to reason and understand the importance of their actions. Much of what we value in other people is not who they are, but how they choose to react to what they are given. In a transhumanist world people’s actions will be totally irrelevant, as any personality flaws can simply be corrected by altering your neurochemistry. The need to cooperate with other people for survival (this is what I think separates humans from animals and transhumans) will also be irrelevant. What is the point of cooperating with other people when you can just create robots to do it for you? What is the point in conversing with others for advice when your supremely intelligent mind can create an answer to any hypothetical problem?

*2.) The potential for torture will be astronomical.*
People like to discuss how ‘happy’ transhumans can potentially be, however they always fail to mention how unhappy they can be as well. Currently there is a limit to how unhappy humans can be. One of the greatest levels of unhappiness occurs by torturing people. Torture, however, has its limits to what it can do to a person. You may even say that death is a blessing in disguise for humans as there is only so much physical and/or mental anguish a person can take before dying. If that does not kill a person, people still age and eventually die due to old age, releasing them from any potential suffering they may be experiencing. In a posthuman world (perhaps in as little as several decades) this may not be the case. It will be possible to keep people alive against their will as unspeakable horrors are inflicted upon them. If this does not scare you, then imagine yourself, a friend or a family member being held in this kind of state indefinitely. Also keep in mind that the level of anguish being inflicted on this person in question is unlike anything a person has ever experienced before.

*3.) Transhumanism is guided by greed and arrogance, not scientific enlightenment.*
Supreme levels of intelligence will be made possible in our lifetimes. These intelligences, whether they be strictly limited to computers, or a combination of man and machine, will be able to give insight into great scientific and philosophical questions that have stumped humanity ever since antiquity. Where did the universe originate? Do people have free will? What is the fate of the universe? Is there a meaning to life? If so, what is it? Is there life after death? Where does consciousness originate? Can it be objectively proven what is the correct set of moral values? Will the debate between science and religion be settled once and for all? Is it even advisable for humanity to step into posthumanity?

Unfortunately, transhumanists *never* mention that we may have the capabilities to answer these questions in our lifetimes. They seem to be more concerned with their own selfish desires (being bigger, faster, stronger, more intelligent, happier, etc). Pursuing these selfish desires with reckless disregard for any negative implications they may hold for everyone else is the pinnacle of greed and arrogance.

*4.) The first three laws of thermodynamics cannot be overcome.*
The three laws of the thermodynamics are the source of all scarcity. There is currently no evidence that they can be overcome, no matter what level of technology is available. Transhumanists arrogantly state that they will live forever. If they are so scientifically informed, then aren’t they aware that we already know the fate of the universe will be a cold landscape devoid of any usable energy? Those that seek immortality have failed before they even started. Death can be delayed, but there is no evidence that it can be avoided entirely. There is no such thing as a post-scarcity world. Like death, the compelling urge to compete with others for scarce energy/resources *may* subside for a time (then again, it may not), however it will not be eliminated forever.

*5.) Humanity is not prepared for transhumanism.*
Even if it were that a transition into a posthuman world was prudent, the question remains: how exactly it should occur? Most humans are totally unaware how close we actually are to living in a posthuman world. Is it really fair to take such a bold leap when most people are not even aware that it is occurring? Not to mention that society will be totally at the mercy of those that acquire the necessary technology first. Also problematic is the inevitable economic chaos that will occur when technology starts increasing at an uncontrollable rate. If you think that transhumanism is something that should be pursued, fine. But do not fool yourself into thinking that it will be a smooth transition. It may very well end up being the most painful trial humanity has ever had to face. There is a good chance that many people reading this will die during the potential chaos and not live to become transhuman.",,5325
